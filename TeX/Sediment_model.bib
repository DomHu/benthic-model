	abstract = {6.6 Summary In this chapter we have summarized the general availability of oxygen, nitrate and phosphate in the oceans and aspects of their significance in the biogeochemical cycles of marine sediments. Oxic respiration is by far the most important pathway of organic carbon in deep-sea sediments and significantly determines the recycling of organic matter introduced onto the sediment surface. Even if some uncertainty remains, benthic oxygen fluxes reveal probably a reasonable approximation to the total carbon oxidation rate under deep-marine conditions. However, benthic fluxes vary considerably in the various ocean basins and the interactions between all parameters controlling benthic biogeochemical activities are not yet completely understood. Above, we showed some examples in which benthic activity deviates from the generally expected situation as suggested by export fluxes from the surface waters. We further elaborate these concepts in Chapter 12 where we summarize existent approaches for the regionalization of benthic fluxes and present methods how to access mineralization processes in surface sediments of the deep-sea globally and arrive at a definition of benthic biogeochemical provinces.},

	abstract = {Sediments are the main repository in the oceanic cycles of carbon (C) and phosphorus (P). In order to relate the deposition of organic C and organic P from the water column, and ultimate burial in sediments, we present a model for the early diagenesis of organic matter in marine sediments. This general diagenetic model was developed for inclusion in global circulation models and is based on a single master variable, the sedimentation rate. The processes included are sediment advection, particle mixing by bioturbation, porewater diffusion, organic matter degradation by aerobic respiration, sulfate reduction, and methanogenesis. Deposition fluxes of organic C and organic P, and the bottomwater concentrations of O2 and SO4= are used as input for the sediment model. First-order kinetics are assumed for the degradation of organic C and organic P (one-G model). Despite the model's simplicity, the model quantitatively reproduces the rates of organic matter oxidation and the burial fluxes of organic C and P. The predicted trends of oxygen penetration depth and the relative importance of oxygen and sulfate reduction are in good agreement with field observations. The model appears to account for the critical biogeochemical and transport processes that control the fate of organic matter in sediments.},

	abstract = {We have extended the 3-D ocean based "Grid ENabled Integrated Earth system model" (GENIE-1) to help understand the role of ocean biogeochemistry and marine sediments in the long-term ({\textasciitilde}100 to 100 000 year) regulation of atmospheric CO2, and the importance of feedbacks between CO2 and climate. Here we describe the ocean carbon cycle, which in its first incarnation is based around a simple single nutrient (phosphate) control on biological productivity. The addition of calcium carbonate preservation in deep-sea sediments and its role in regulating atmospheric CO2 is presented elsewhere (Ridgwell and Hargreaves, 2007).  We have calibrated the model parameters controlling ocean carbon cycling in GENIE-1 by assimilating 3-D observational datasets of phosphate and alkalinity using an ensemble Kalman filter method. The calibrated (mean) model predicts a global export production of particulate organic carbon (POC) of 8.9 PgC yr?1, and reproduces the main features of dissolved oxygen distributions in the ocean. For estimating biogenic calcium carbonate (CaCO3) production, we have devised a parameterization in which the CaCO3:POC export ratio is related directly to ambient saturation state. Calibrated global CaCO3 export production (1.2 PgC yr-1) is close to recent marine carbonate budget estimates.  The GENIE-1 Earth system model is capable of simulating a wide variety of dissolved and isotopic species of relevance to the study of modern global biogeochemical cycles as well as past global environmental changes recorded in paleoceanographic proxies. Importantly, even with 12 active biogeochemical tracers in the ocean and including the calculation of feedbacks between atmospheric CO2 and climate, we achieve better than 1000 years per (2.4 GHz) CPU hour on a desktop PC. The GENIE-1 model thus provides a viable alternative to box and zonally-averaged models for studying global biogeochemical cycling over all but the very longest ({\textgreater}1 000 000 year) time-scales.},

	abstract = {Results are presented of export production, dissolved organic matter (DOM) and dissolved oxygen simulated by 12 global ocean models participating in the second phase of the Ocean Carbon-cycle Model Intercomparison Project. A common, simple biogeochemical model is utilized in different coarse-resolution ocean circulation models. The model mean (±1σ) downward flux of organic matter across 75 m depth is 17 ± 6 Pg C yr−1. Model means of globally averaged particle export, the fraction of total export in dissolved form, surface semilabile dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and seasonal net outgassing (SNO) of oxygen are in good agreement with observation-based estimates, but particle export and surface DOC are too high in the tropics. There is a high sensitivity of the results to circulation, as evidenced by (1) the correlation of surface DOC and export with circulation metrics, including chlorofluorocarbon inventory and deep-ocean radiocarbon, (2) very large intermodel differences in Southern Ocean export, and (3) greater export production, fraction of export as DOM, and SNO in models with explicit mixed layer physics. However, deep-ocean oxygen, which varies widely among the models, is poorly correlated with other model indices. Cross-model means of several biogeochemical metrics show better agreement with observation-based estimates when restricted to those models that best simulate deep-ocean radiocarbon. Overall, the results emphasize the importance of physical processes in marine biogeochemical modeling and suggest that the development of circulation models can be accelerated by evaluating them with marine biogeochemical metrics.},

In particular, we highlight a Mid-Mesozoic Revolution in the nature and location of carbonate deposition in the marine environment, driven by the ecological success of calcareous plankton. This drove the creation of a responsive deep-sea sedimentary sink of CaCO3. The result is that biologically driven carbonate deposition provides a significant buffering of ocean chemistry and of atmospheric CO2 in the modern system. However, the same calcifying organisms that under-pin the deep-sea carbonate sink are now threatened by the continued atmospheric release of fossil fuel CO2 and increasing acidity of the surface ocean. We are not yet in a position to predict what the impact on CaCO3 production will be, or how the uptake of fossil fuel CO2 by the ocean will be affected. This uncertainty in the future trajectory of atmospheric CO2 that comes from incomplete understanding of the marine carbonate cycle is cause for concern.},

The weathering of silicate and carbonate rocks and ancient sedimentary organic matter (including recent, large-scale human-induced burning of fossil fuels), the burial of organic matter and carbonate minerals in sediments, and volcanic degassing of carbon dioxide contribute to this cycle. In The Phanerozoic Carbon Cycle, Robert Berner shows how carbon cycle models can be used to calculate levels of atmospheric CO2 and O2 over Phanerozoic time, the past 550 million years, and how results compare with independent methods.

In a theoretical treatment of early diagenesis, Robert Berner shows how a rigorous development of the mathematical modeling of diagenetic processes can be useful to the understanding and interpretation of both experimental and field observations. His book is unique in that the models are based on quantitative rate expressions, in contrast to the qualitative descriptions that have dominated the field. In the opening chapters, the author develops the mathematical theory of early diagenesis, introducing a general diagenetic equation and discussing it in terms of each major diagenetic process. Included are the derivations of basic rate equations for diffusion, compaction, pore-water flow, burial advection, bioturbation, adsorption, radioactive decay, and especially chemical and biochemical reactions. Drawing on examples from the recent literature on continental-margin, pelagic, and non-marine sediments, he then illustrates the power of these diagenetic models in the study of such deposits. The book is intended not only for earth scientists studying sediments and sedimentary rocks, but also for researchers in fields such as radioactive waste disposal, petroleum and economic geology, environmental pollution, and sea-floor engineering.},

	abstract = {Variance-based approaches are widely used for Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) of environmental models. However, methods that consider the entire Probability Density Function (PDF) of the model output, rather than its variance only, are preferable in cases where variance is not an adequate proxy of uncertainty, e.g. when the output distribution is highly-skewed or when it is multi-modal. Still, the adoption of density-based methods has been limited so far, possibly because they are relatively more difficult to implement. Here we present a novel GSA method, called PAWN, to efficiently compute density-based sensitivity indices.

	abstract = {The global carbon cycle is part of the much more extensive sedimentary cycle that involves large masses of carbon in the Earth's inner and outer spheres. Studies of the carbon cycle generally followed a progression in knowledge of the natural biological, then chemical, and finally geological processes involved, culminating in a more or less integrated picture of the biogeochemical carbon cycle by the 1920s. However, knowledge of the ocean's carbon cycle behavior has only within the last few decades progressed to a stage where meaningful discussion of carbon processes on an annual to millennial time scale can take place. In geologically older and pre-industrial time, the ocean was generally a net source of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere owing to the mineralization of land-derived organic matter in addition to that produced in situ and to the process of CaCO3 precipitation. Due to rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations because of fossil fuel combustion and land use changes, the direction of the air-sea CO2 flux has reversed, leading to the ocean as a whole being a net sink of anthropogenic CO2. The present thickness of the surface ocean layer, where part of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions are stored, is estimated as of the order of a few hundred meters. The oceanic coastal zone net air-sea CO2 exchange flux has also probably changed during industrial time. Model projections indicate that in preindustrial times, the coastal zone may have been net heterotrophic, releasing CO2 to the atmosphere from the imbalance between gross photosynthesis and total respiration. This, coupled with extensive CaCO3 precipitation in coastal zone environments, led to a net flux of CO2 out of the system. During industrial time the coastal zone ocean has tended to reverse its trophic status toward a non-steady state situation of net autotrophy, resulting in net uptake of anthropogenic CO2 and storage of carbon in the coastal ocean, despite the significant calcification that still occurs in this region. Furthermore, evidence from the inorganic carbon cycle indicates that deposition and net storage of CaCO3 in sediments exceed inflow of inorganic carbon from land and produce CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. In the shallow-water coastal zone, increase in atmospheric CO2 during the last 300 years of industrial time may have reduced the rate of calcification, and continuation of this trend is an issue of serious environmental concern in the global carbon balance.},

Simulations carried out with an idealized 1D model of detritus sinking show that a coarse vertical resolution, such as used in many global biogeochemical models, tends to enhance the particle flux through numerical mixing within the vertical boxes, and thereby simulates deeper remineralization, compared to a model with a fine vertical resolution. This effect can be ameliorated by assuming a distribution of detritus within the individual grid boxes that corresponds to the prescribed sinking and remineralization parameters. Experiments of the different flux algorithms, carried out with 3D global biogeochemical models of different vertical grid resolution reveal impacts on simulated biogeochemical tracer distributions that are similar to those obtained by substantial variations in biogeochemical model parameters. Our results indicate that numerical schemes have to be considered when comparing biogeochemical parameter values of different models and also when porting biogeochemical models among different circulation models.},

	abstract = {Mutual interaction of water column and sediment processes is either neglected or only crudely approximated in many biogeochemical models.

We have reviewed the approaches to couple benthic and pelagic biogeochemical models. It is concluded that they can be classified into a hierarchical set consisting of five levels, differing in the amount of detail given to the sediment processes. The most complex approach (level 4) fully couples water column processes to a vertically resolved biogeochemical sediment model. First simplification is achieved by using a vertically integrated dynamic sediment model (level 3); next is a reflective type of boundary (level 2) where particulate material arriving at the sediment surface is instantaneously transformed into dissolved components. Then comes a set of models in which either the bottom-water concentration of dissolved substances or the sediment–water exchange is imposed (level 1). Finally, in some biogeochemical models, the bottom is plainly ignored (level 0).

We have tested these various approaches in a coupled physical–pelagic–benthic biogeochemical model for oxygen, nitrogen and carbon cycling in continental shelf areas. We discuss the various model approaches with respect to their impact on the pelagic system and point out some of the inconsistencies hidden in certain formulations. We conclude that lower boundary types, in which sediment fluxes or concentrations are imposed (level 1), are especially badly designed because they fail to assure conservation of mass.

Finally, we suggest as best choice a level 3 approach in which the evolution of sedimentary particulate matter is part of the solution and where the bottom fluxes of dissolved constituents are parameterised based on mass budget considerations. These simplified formulations represent the best balance between computational demand and attained accuracy.},

	abstract = {Total alkalinity (TA) is one of the few measurable quantities that can be used together with other quantities to calculate concentrations of species of the carbonate system (CO2, HCO3−, CO32−, H+, OH−). TA and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) are conservative quantities with respect to mixing and changes in temperature and pressure and are, therefore, used in oceanic carbon cycle models. Thus it is important to understand the changes of TA due to various biogeochemical processes such as formation and remineralization of organic matter by microalgae, precipitation and dissolution of calcium carbonate. Unfortunately deriving such changes from the common expression for TA in terms of concentrations of non-conservative chemical species (HCO3−, CO32−, B(OH)4−, H+, OH−, etc.) is rarely obvious.

Here an expression for TA (TAec) in terms of the total concentrations of certain major ions (Na+, Cl−, Ca2+ etc.) and the total concentrations of various acid-base species (total phosphate etc.) is derived from Dickson's original definition of TA under the constraint of electroneutrality. Changes of TA by various biogeochemical processes are easy to derive from this so-called explicit conservative expression for TA because each term in this expression is independent of changes of temperature or pressure within the ranges normally encountered in the ocean and obeys a linear mixing relation.

Further, the constrains of electroneutrality for nutrient uptake by microalgae and photoautotrophs are discussed. A so-called nutrient-H+-compensation principle is proposed. This principle in combination with TAec allows one to make predictions for changes in TA due to uptake of nutrients that are consistent with observations. A new prediction based on this principle is the change in TA due to nitrogen fixation followed by remineralization of organic matter and subsequent nitrification of ammonia which implies a significant sink of TA in tropical and subtropical regions where most of the nitrogen fixation takes place.},

	abstract = {The global-scale quantification of organic carbon (Corg) degradation pathways in marine sediments is difficult to achieve experimentally due to the limited availability of field data. In the present study, a numerical modeling approach is used as an alternative to quantify the major metabolic pathways of Corg oxidation (Cox) and associated fluxes of redox-sensitive species fluxes along a global ocean hypsometry, using the seafloor depth (SFD) as the master variable. The SFD dependency of the model parameters and forcing functions is extracted from existing empirical relationships or from the NOAA World Ocean Atlas. Results are in general agreement with estimates from the literature showing that the relative contribution of aerobic respiration to Cox increases from {\textless}10\% at shallow SFD to {\textgreater}80\% in deep-sea sediments. Sulfate reduction essentially follows an inversed SFD dependency, the other metabolic pathways (denitrification, Mn and Fe reduction) only adding minor contributions to the global-scale mineralization of Corg. The hypsometric analysis allows the establishment of relationships between the individual terminal electron acceptor (TEA) fluxes across the sediment-water interface and their respective contributions to the Corg decomposition process. On a global average, simulation results indicate that sulfate reduction is the dominant metabolic pathway and accounts for approximately 76\% of the total Cox, which is higher than reported so far by other authors. The results also demonstrate the importance of bioirrigation for the assessment of global species fluxes. Especially at shallow SFD most of the TEAs enter the sediments via bioirrigation, which complicates the use of concentration profiles for the determination of total TEA fluxes by molecular diffusion. Furthermore, bioirrigation accounts for major losses of reduced species from the sediment to the water column prohibiting their reoxidation inside the sediment. As a result, the total carbon mineralization rate exceeds the total flux of oxygen into the sediment by a factor of 2 globally.},

	abstract = {Diagenesis of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and manganese at three sites on the Canadian continental margin is quantitatively compared and contrasted using results from a computer code (CANDI) published by Boudreau (1996a). The data at Station 3 (Cabot Strait) are well explained by the steady state output from CANDI, assuming a porewater balance created by diffusion and reaction only, whereas the data from Stations 4 (Emerald Basin-Scotia Shelf) and 5 (Scotia Slope) are not consistent, in one way or another, with this simple model. The deviations between model and data at Station 4 are best explained by nonsteady-state diagenesis. Model fits to the Station 5 ΣCO2 observations are improved dramatically by adding some irrigation at this site, but the ΣNH3 distribution appears to be subject to an additional anomalous transport to the O2 zone and subsequent oxidation to NO-3. The mechanism for this latter phenomena is unknown and in need of future research. In addition, the O2 and ΣCO2 profiles at all sites require the existence of at least two reactive organic matter types; furthermore, the initial amounts of these OM types at each station is strongly dependent on the intensity of particle bioturbation. Ammonia is preferentially regenerated at Station 3 at a high ratio of about 25 N to 106 C. The net kinetics of the deeper removal of Mn2+ appear to be fractional-order with respect to the concentration of this species, suggesting multiple removal processes. Finally, an oxidant balance, assuming steady state, indicates a considerable difference in the use of oxidants at each station even though the O2 fluxes are similar.},

	abstract = {A reduction of the carbonate-carbon to organic-carbon export rain ratio during glacial times has been advanced to explain the glacial–interglacial atmospheric CO2CO2 variations. This hypothesis is tested and implications for the dynamics of sedimentary carbonate preservation and dissolution are explored with a multi-box model (mbm) of the ocean carbon cycle, fully coupled to a new transient early diagenesis model (called medusa).
A peak reduction of the rain ratio by 40\% at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) was found to produce a net atmospheric pCO2pCO2 reduction of about 40 ppm. Changing shelf carbonate accumulation rates and continental weathering inputs produced a 55–60 ppm reduction. The combination of the two mechanisms generates a pCO2pCO2 change of 90–95 ppm, which compares well with the observed data. However, the resulting model sedimentary record does not conform to actual sedimentary records. The changes related to continental shelf processes and variable weathering flux depress the calcite saturation horizon (CSH) by about 1 km at the LGM; if rain ratio variations are also considered, that depression increases by another km. In addition to this large amplitude for the CSH, possibly due to the adopted box-model approach, the changing rain ratio also leads to transition zone changes in the model sedimentary record that are opposite in phase with data-based reconstructions. Realistic changes in the aragonite fraction of the carbonate rain were found to have only a minimal impact on atmospheric pCO2pCO2. Finally, chemical erosion of deep-sea sediment was shown to reduce the amplitude of variation of the sedimentary CCD by about 10–20\%. It may provide a mechanism to improve the model-data agreement.},

In addition, the model includes a description of surface sediments and organic carbon early diagenesis. Model output is compared to data or data based estimates of ocean productivity, pe-ratios, particle fluxes, surface sediment bulk composition and benthic O2 fluxes. Model results suggest that different processes control POC fluxes at different depths. In the wind mixed layer turbulent particle coagulation appears as key process in controlling pe-ratios. Parameterization (2) yields simulated pe-ratios that compare well to observations. Below the wind mixed layer, POC fluxes are most sensitive to the intensity of zooplankton flux feeding, indicating the importance of zooplankton community composition. All model parameters being kept constant, the capability of the model to reproduce yearly mean POC fluxes below 2000 m and benthic oxygen demand does at first order not dependent on the resolution of the particle size spectrum. Aggregate formation appears essential to initiate an intense biological pump. At great depth the reported close to constant particle fluxes are most likely the result of the combined effect of aggregate formation and mineral ballasting.},

	abstract = {The recently developed Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM) is employed for simulations contributing to the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5) experiments and the fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-AR5). In this manuscript, we focus on evaluating the ocean and land carbon cycle components of the NorESM, based on the preindustrial control and historical simulations. Many of the observed large scale ocean biogeochemical features are reproduced satisfactorily by the NorESM. When compared to the climatological estimates from the World Ocean Atlas (WOA), the model simulated temperature, salinity, oxygen, and phosphate distributions agree reasonably well in both the surface layer and deep water structure. However, the model simulates a relatively strong overturning circulation strength that leads to noticeable model-data bias, especially within the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). This strong overturning circulation slightly distorts the structure of the biogeochemical tracers at depth. Advancements in simulating the oceanic mixed layer depth with respect to the previous generation model particularly improve the surface tracer distribution as well as the upper ocean biogeochemical processes, particularly in the Southern Ocean. Consequently, near-surface ocean processes such as biological production and air–sea gas exchange, are in good agreement with climatological observations. The NorESM adopts the same terrestrial model as the Community Earth System Model (CESM1). It reproduces the general pattern of land-vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP) when compared to the observationally based values derived from the FLUXNET network of eddy covariance towers. While the model simulates well the vegetation carbon pool, the soil carbon pool is smaller by a factor of three relative to the observational based estimates. The simulated annual mean terrestrial GPP and total respiration are slightly larger than observed, but the difference between the global GPP and respiration is comparable. Model-data bias in GPP is mainly simulated in the tropics (overestimation) and in high latitudes (underestimation). Within the NorESM framework, both the ocean and terrestrial carbon cycle models simulate a steady increase in carbon uptake from the preindustrial period to the present-day. The land carbon uptake is noticeably smaller than the observations, which is attributed to the strong nitrogen limitation formulated by the land model.},

	abstract = {A new, low-order Earth System Model is described, calibrated and tested against Earth system data. The model features modules for the atmosphere, ocean, ocean sediment, land biosphere and lithosphere and has been designed to simulate global change on time scales of years to millions of years. The atmosphere module considers radiation balance, meridional transport of heat and water vapor between low-mid latitude and high latitude zones, heat and gas exchange with the ocean and sea ice and snow cover. Gases considered are carbon dioxide and methane for all three carbon isotopes, nitrous oxide and oxygen. The ocean module has 100 m vertical resolution, carbonate chemistry and prescribed circulation and mixing. Ocean biogeochemical tracers are phosphate, dissolved oxygen, dissolved inorganic carbon for all three carbon isotopes and alkalinity. Biogenic production of particulate organic matter in the ocean surface layer depends on phosphate availability but with lower efficiency in the high latitude zone, as determined by model fit to ocean data. The calcite to organic carbon rain ratio depends on surface layer temperature. The semi-analytical, ocean sediment module considers calcium carbonate dissolution and oxic and anoxic organic matter remineralisation. The sediment is composed of calcite, non-calcite mineral and reactive organic matter. Sediment porosity profiles are related to sediment composition and a bioturbated layer of 0.1 m thickness is assumed. A sediment segment is ascribed to each ocean layer and segment area stems from observed ocean depth distributions. Sediment burial is calculated from sedimentation velocities at the base of the bioturbated layer. Bioturbation rates and oxic and anoxic remineralisation rates depend on organic carbon rain rates and dissolved oxygen concentrations. The land biosphere module considers leaves, wood, litter and soil. Net primary production depends on atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and remineralization rates in the litter and soil are related to mean atmospheric temperatures. Methane production is a small fraction of the soil remineralization. The lithosphere module considers outgassing, weathering of carbonate and silicate rocks and weathering of rocks containing old organic carbon and phosphorus. Weathering rates are related to mean atmospheric temperatures. A pre-industrial, steady state calibration to Earth system data is carried out. Ocean observations of temperature, carbon 14, phosphate, dissolved oxygen, dissolved inorganic carbon and alkalinity constrain air-sea exchange and ocean circulation, mixing and biogeochemical parameters. Observed calcite and organic carbon distributions and inventories in the ocean sediment help constrain sediment module parameters. Carbon isotopic data and carbonate vs. silicate weathering fractions are used to estimate initial lithosphere outgassing and rock weathering rates. Model performance is tested by simulating atmospheric greenhouse gas increases, global warming and model tracer evolution for the period 1765 to 2000, as forced by prescribed anthropogenic greenhouse gas inputs and other anthropogenic and natural forcing. Long term, transient model behavior is studied with a set of 100 000 year simulations, forced by a slow, 5000 Gt C input of CO2 to the atmosphere, and with a 1.5 million year simulation, forced by a doubling of lithosphere CO2 outgassing.},

	abstract = {The MEDIA (Modelling Early DIAgenesis) software package comprises a flexible and extensible software system that provides problem-solving assistance for simulating 1D reactive transport in surface sediments. MEDIA allows multiple diagenetic models to be built by extending a model template with new model components from a toolbox of available objects (elements, species, parameters, reactions). A detailed review is given of the transport and reaction components available for model construction. Upon assemblage, the model is channelled to the numerical subunit of the MEDIA package. Via a canonical transformation, the user-defined mixed kinetic-equilibrium model is rearranged into a proper set of differential algebraic equations (DAE), for which both steady state and transient solutions can be calculated. Steady-state profiles are obtained either directly using a Newton–Raphson method, or alternatively, as the asymptotic result of a dynamic simulation. Dynamic simulations involve a global implicit procedure based on the stiff-ODE solver package VODE, employing a direct substitution approach to reduce the number of equations in the DAE system. Verification of the MEDIA code was accomplished (1) by comparison with analytic models and (2) by emulating the model formulation and output of the existing diagenetic model code STEADYSED. As an example application, a diagenetic model was constructed to analyse an extensive dataset collected from a marine sediment in the Santa Barbara Basin (California). The different pathways of organic matter mineralization were modelled, and the coupling among the biogeochemical cycles of C, O, N, S, Mn and Fe was investigated. Depth profiles of both porewater and solid-phase constituents could be reproduced with great accuracy.},

	abstract = {In this study, we use a biogeochemical ocean general circulation model (HAMOCC), originally developed for the carbon and silicon cycles, and expand it with a description of the sedimentary phosphorus (P) cycle. The model simulates the release of reactive P by aerobic and anaerobic degradation of organic matter in the sediment, as well as formation and burial of Fe-oxide bound P and authigenic Ca-P minerals. We also include pre-anthropogenic inputs of P from atmospheric dust, which is mostly in the form of detrital apatite. Model predicted total P concentrations and rates of reactive P burial for the deep sea agree reasonably well with observations in open ocean and near continental margin sediments. As part of a sensitivity analysis, we assess the long-term response of ocean productivity and deep water oxygenation to increases in the riverine input of P and preferential release of P from sediments. The simulations show that the feedback from preferential P regeneration accelerates the expansion of suboxia (O2 {\textless} 25 μM) along continental margins and in the naturally suboxic areas in tropical-subtropical regions on timescales of 10–100 ka. For a case in which maximum P regeneration from sediments is enabled, a large-scale pattern of bottom water suboxia (30\% of the total ocean area) develops over the southeastern, tropical and northern Pacific Ocean sectors.},

	abstract = {An empirical function is derived for predicting the rate-depth profile of particulate organic carbon (POC) degradation in surface marine sediments including the bioturbated layer. The rate takes the form of a power law analogous to the Middelburg function. The functional parameters were optimized by simulating measured benthic O2 and NO3− fluxes at 185 stations worldwide using a diagenetic model. The novelty of this work rests with the finding that the vertically resolved POC degradation rate in the bioturbated zone can be determined using a simple function where the POC rain rate is the governing variable. Although imperfect, the model is able to fit 71\% of paired O2 and NO3− fluxes to within 50\% of measured values. It further provides realistic geochemical concentration-depth profiles, NO3− penetration depths, and apparent first-order POC mineralization rate constants. The model performs less well on the continental shelf due to the high sediment heterogeneity there. When applied to globally resolved maps of rain rate, the model predicts a global denitrification rate of 182 ± 88 Tg yr−1 of N and a POC burial rate of 107 ± 52 Tg yr−1 of C with a mean carbon burial efficiency of 6.1\%. These results are in very good agreement with published values. Our proposed function is conceptually simple, requires less parameterization than multi-G-type models, and is suitable for nonsteady state applications. It provides a basis for more accurately simulating benthic nutrient fluxes and carbonate dissolution rates in Earth system models.},

	abstract = {Measurements of CO2 to air ratios in the gas trapped in bubbles in ice of glacial age suggest that the CO2 content of the atmosphere was considerably lower during peak glacial time than during Holocene time. The purpose of this paper is to show that such a change must in all likelihood be the result of alterations in the nutrient element chemistry of sea water. Two possible scenarios are presented. One involves alternate storage and erosion of phosphorous leaving residues from shelf sediments. The other involves changes in the CP ratio in the organic debris falling to the deep sea. Means of verifying the nutrient cycle hypothesis are also given. It is shown that the 13C record as we know it in planktonic and benthic foraminifera, the oxygen record as inferred from benthic foraminifera species distributions, and the early post glacial CaCo3 preservation event as recorded by aragonitic pteropods are consistent with both of the hypotheses presented. Only if an early post glacial spike in the 13C record for planktonic shells could be found would it be possible to eliminate one of these hypotheses (i.e., that involving shelf storage). The implications of these nutrient hypotheses to climate theory are as follows. If shelf storage is responsible for the glacial to interglacial CO2 increase, then the CO2 change must be considered an amplifier of some primary cause. The reason is that sea level changes are needed to drive deposition on (and erosion from) the shelves. On the other hand, if changes in the CP ratio for falling debris are responsible, then the CO2 change could either be an amplifier or a primary cause for the major glacial to interglacial climatic cycle. The latter is possible as self-sustained oscillations in ocean chemistry might be driven by interactions between ocean ecology and ocean nutrient chemistry.},

	abstract = {We present a new model for oxic and anoxic diagenesis of shallow and deep-sea sediments based on an efficient solver for steady state pore water and solid phase diffusion/reaction/advection equations. The model, called “Muds”, is orders of magnitude faster than solvers of the corresponding time-dependent equations. The model resolves Mn and Fe/S geochemistry as well as pore water pH and CaCO3 dissolution. The model speed opens application possibilities that are impossible for time-dependent models, including automatic tuning of uncertain parameters, and deployment of the model in gridded global domains. The kinetic rate constants for respiration and bioturbation are parameterized as functions of the organic carbon rain to the seafloor, based on existing parameterizations in the literature. Seven uncertain model parameters, including many of the rate constant parameterizations, were tuned to minimize the misfit to observations from 53 sedimentary locations throughout the ocean. The model tuning knobs were the fractions of labile and refractory organic matter in the sedimenting material, the NO3−, Mn, Fe, and S respiration rate constant parameterizations, and the depth scales of respiration and of pore water irrigation. We searched for adequate fit values of these parameterizations using a simulated annealing method. The cost function (degree of misfit) was based on a comparison of pore water (NO3−, NH4+, Mn2+, and Fe2+) and solid phase (organic carbon and MnO2) model results with data. Many of the tuning parameters are constrained to ±50\% or better. The model is most skillful at predicting organic carbon concentration, depth of NO3− penetration, and pore water Fe2+, and less so for Mn2+, NH4+, and solid phase MnO2. The model misses some of the very high sediment surface MnO2 concentrations observed in, for example, the California Borderlands. We believe that these sites must receive a higher input of reactive Mn than the crustal abundance of the clay rain. The model was deployed on every 2° × 2° grid point below 1000 m of the global seafloor, using gridded maps of organic carbon rain to the seafloor and overlying water chemistry. The deep-sea carbon burial efficiency is 7\%, with 95\% of respiration by oxic metabolism. The model was also run against a new depth-oxygen hypsometry of the global ocean, with sediment area as a function of overlying oxygen concentration and average depth related to carbon fluxes, to include the effects of shallow water sediments. This analysis predicts that shallow waters ({\textless}1000 m) account for 88\% of respiration, and oxygen accounts for 66\% of respiration overall. Denitrification is closely coupled to organic nitrogen fluxes to the sediment, and the global rate is estimated to be 1.4 × 1014 mol yr−1, a factor of 6–8 higher than the corresponding estimate from Middelburg et al. [1996], throwing the nitrogen cycle in the ocean into imbalance.},

	abstract = {We present a numerical model of sedimentary early diagenetic processes that includes oxic and anoxic mineralization. The model belongs to the new wave of early diagenesis models that account for depth-dependent bioturbation and porosity profiles; it can be used both for calculating steady-state conditions and transient simulation. It was developed to reproduce the cycling of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen along the ocean margin; it resolves the sediment-depth profiles of carbon, oxygen, nitrate, ammonium, and other reduced substances.

Organic carbon is modeled as two degradable fractions with different first-order degradation rates and nitrogen:carbon ratios, to account for the decreasing reactivity and N/C ratio of the organic matter with depth into the sediment. The consumption of oxygen and nitrate as terminal electron acceptors is explicitly modeled, and mineralization is limited both by carbon (first order kinetics) and by oxidant availability (Michaelis-Menten type kinetics). Nitrification and oxic mineralization are decoupled, which allows the description of ammonium profiles. Mineralization processes using other oxidants (manganese oxides, iron oxides, sulphate) are lumped into one process, where degradation is only carbon limited; the terminal electron acceptors are not explicitly modeled, only the production of reduced substances is described. These substances are in part permanently removed (e.g., pyrite formation below the bioturbation zone) and partly diffuse towards the oxic layer where they react with oxygen.

The values of several parameters were constrained using literature-derived relationships. The model was calibrated on a dataset obtained from the literature, which relates the magnitude of the different pathways to total organic carbon mineralization. The influence of carbon flux, bioturbation, sedimentation rate, bottomwater concentrations of oxygen, and nitrate and carbon degradability on the different mineralization pathways is examined. The relative contribution of the oxic mineralization in the model is significantly depressed under high organic flux, under low bottomwater oxygen conditions and when the bioturbation increases; higher carbon degradability has only a small positive effect, while sedimentation rate is relatively unimportant. Denitrification is mainly influenced by the nitrate concentration in the overlying bottomwater.},

	abstract = {The ratio of phosphate and nitrate concentrations in the deep ocean matches closely the Redfield ratio required by phytoplankton growing in the surface ocean. Furthermore, the oxygen available from dissolution in ocean water is, on average, just sufficient for the respiration of the resulting organic matter. We review various feedback mechanisms that have been proposed to account for these remarkable correspondences and construct a model to test their effectiveness. The model's initial steady state is cate responds to perturbation in 1000–2000 years and phosphate in 40,000-60,000 years. However, recently increased estimates oflose to the Redfield ratios and stable against instantaneous changes in the sizes of the nitrate and phosphate reservoirs. When classic flux estimates are adopted, nitr the input and output fluxes of nitrate and phosphate suggest that they respond more rapidly to perturbation, nitrate in 500–1000 years and phosphate in 10,000–15,000 years. Nitrogen fixation tends to maintain nitrate close to Redfield ratio with phosphate, while denitrification tends to keep nitrate as the proximate limiting nutrient and tie it in Redfield ratio to dissolved oxygen. Under increases in phosphorus input to the ocean, the relative responsiveness of nitrogen fixation and denitrification determine whether nitrate remains close to Redfield ratio to phosphate or to oxygen. If nitrogen fixation is strongly limited (e.g., by lack of iron), increasing phosphorus input to the ocean can cause phosphate to deviate above Redfield ratio to nitrate. Hence nitrogen dynamics can control phosphate behavior and nitrate can potentially be the ultimate limiting nutrient over geologic periods of time. When nitrate and phosphate are coupled together by responsive nitrogen fixation, negative feedbacks on organic and calcium-bound phosphorus burial stabilize their concentrations. If anoxia suppresses organic phosphorus burial, the resulting feedbacks on phosphate (positive) and oxygen (negative) improve regulation toward the Redfield ratios. Variants of the model are forced with a global record of phosphorus accumulation in biogenic sediments as a proxy for changes in phosphate input to the ocean over the past 40 Myr. Nitrate is generally regulated close to Redfield ratio to phosphate, despite large changes in phosphorus input. If nitrogen fixation is strongly limited, then there is one interval (∼15 Myr ago) when a very rapid increase in phosphate input forces phosphate above Redfield ratio to nitrate. Decreases in phosphorus input cause phosphate and nitrate to quickly deviate below Redfield ratio with oxygen, removing anoxia from the ocean, while increases in phosphorus input rapidly increase anoxia. Hence we conclude that there appears to be an element of chance in observing today's ocean “on the edge of anoxia” with nitrate, phosphate, and oxygen all close to the Redfield ratios.},

These data show, consistent with the findings of Jørgensen (1982, Nature, 296, 643–645), that sulfate reduction and oxic respiration oxidize equal amounts of organic carbon in nearshore sediments. As sedimentation rates decrease, oxic respiration becomes progressively more important, and in deep-sea sediments 100–1000 times more organic carbon is oxidized by oxic respiration than by sulfate reduction. By contrast, nearly as much organic carbon is oxidized by sulfate reduction in euxinic sediments as is oxidized by the sum of sulfate reduction and oxic respiration in normal marine sediments of similar deposition rate. This observation appears at odds with the enhanced preservation of organic carbon observed in euxinic sediments. However, only small reductions in (depth-integrated) organic carbon decomposition rates (compared to normal marine) are required to give both high organic carbon concentrations and enhanced carbon preservation in euxinic sediments. Lower rates of organic carbon decomposition (if only by subtle amounts) are explained by the diminished ability of anaerobic bacteria to oxidize the full suite of sedimentary organic compounds.},

Accumulation rates of phosphorus (P) bound to iron, organic matter, and authigenic phosphate are shown to rise and arrive at a distinct maximum at the onset of OAE 2, with an associated increase in δ13C values. Accumulation rates of P return to pre-excursion values in the interval where the δ13C record reaches its first maximum. An offset in time between the maximum in P accumulation and peaks in organic carbon burial, hydrogen indices, and Corg/Preact molar ratios is explained by the evolution of OAE 2 in the following steps. (1) An increase in productivity increased the flux of organic matter and P into the sediments; the preservation of organic matter was low and its oxidation released P, which was predominantly mineralized. (2) Enhanced productivity and oxidation of organic matter created dysoxic bottom waters; the preservation potential for organic matter increased, whereas the sediment retention potential for P decreased. (3) The latter effect sustained high primary productivity, which led to an increase in the abundance of free oxygen in the ocean and atmosphere system. After the sequestration of CO2 in the form of black shales, this oxygen helped push the ocean back into equilibrium, terminating black shale deposition and removing bioavailable P from the water column.},

	abstract = {Organic-carbon-rich sediments (“black shales”) were deposited at some 40 Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) sites in the Atlantic Ocean during Late Jurassic and Cretaceous times. In order to reconstruct the depositional environments of black shale formation, we have studied in detail changes in the occurrence of black shales as well as the type and amount of organic matter in relation to changes in paleogeography, paleooceanic circulation and paleoclimate. We have calculated accumulation rates of marine and terrigenous organic carbon and combined these with organic carbon content—sedimentation rate relationships to obtain information about paleoenvironments.

Main factors causing the preservation and accumulation of organic carbon are: (1) the supply of terrestrial organic matter; (2) the supply of marine organic matter; (3) the oxygenation of the deep water; and (4) the bulk sedimentation rate. Changes in the importance of these different factors and changes in the interrelationships among them determine the complex system of black shale formation and their cyclic variations.

Increased supply of terrestrial organic matter due to increased river discharge and humid climate in Northeast America, Southwest Europe and South Africa were important in the Hauterivian—Albian Northwest and northern Northeast Atlantic and in the Late Jurassic—Aptian South Atlantic. In the latter, anoxic deep-water conditions due to restricted circulation in the nascent largely isolated basin as well as higher oceanic productivity, may have reinforced the high preservation rates of marine organic matter during that time. Off Northwest Africa, higher flux rates of marine organic matter were recorded in areas of higher productivity which may have been caused by fluvial nutrient supply during the Hauterivian and by intensified upwelling during Albian/Turonian times. In general, the depositional environment was oxygenated and the content of marine organic matter was a function of the sedimentation rate. Furthermore, at some places redeposition by turbidity currents or slumps may have been important for the accumulation of organic matter in the deep-sea basins. The only episode of widespread anoxia in the western and eastern basins of the North Atlantic may have occurred in the Cenomanian—Turonian when high amounts of marine organic matter were also preserved in areas of low productivity and low sedimentation rates.},

	abstract = {After three decades of research on the correlation between sea level and various proxies, there has been very little quantification of the first-order influence of sea level change on nutrient inventory, marine productivity, and burial of organic carbon. We present a model aimed at quantifying the burial of organic carbon as a function of sea level rise. The biogeochemical model explicitly considers the mean surface area distribution of the Earth as a function of elevation. Also included is dissolved inorganic phosphate (DIP) liberated from coastal sediments during transgression. We quantify how sea level rise of magnitudes inferred for the mid-Cretaceous influences the phosphorus cycle and burial of organic carbon. The burial efficiency is greater on the shelf. Therefore, in the model, the larger shelf area under high sea level results in more efficient burial of marine organic carbon for a given DIP concentration and associated new production of organic matter (NP). With a Late Cretaceous model shelf area the residence time of DIP decreases by 60\% relative to the present-day reference. Thus, in the final steady state, DIP and NP in the open ocean are reduced compared to today when the biologically reactive phosphorus (Preac) fluxes to the ocean from land are held constant. The lower new production reduces the oxygen demand for respiration and results in a significant oxygenation of the global ocean. Finally, the global organic carbon burial decreases by 30\% relative to today in the model. This decrease results from feedbacks between the flux of organic carbon to the seafloor and the ratio of organic carbon to Preac in buried sediments. In contrast, during sea level rise, coastal erosion may increase the Preac flux to the ocean by up to ∼20\% relative to today and cause a temporary increase in DIP concentration in the ocean. The resulting increase in organic carbon burial is equivalent to a carbon isotope event of +0.5 to 1‰. Larger carbon isotope events can be triggered by sea level rise only when the ocean is sufficiently close to anoxia in the oxygen minimum zone just prior to the sea level rise.},

	abstract = {Oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) record profound changes in the climatic and paleoceanographic state of the planet and represent major disturbances in the global carbon cycle. OAEs that manifestly caused major chemical change in the Mesozoic Ocean include those of the early Toarcian (Posidonienschiefer event, T-OAE, ∼183 Ma), early Aptian (Selli event, OAE 1a, ∼120 Ma), early Albian (Paquier event, OAE 1b, ∼111 Ma), and Cenomanian–Turonian (Bonarelli event, C/T OAE, OAE 2, ∼93 Ma). Currently available data suggest that the major forcing function behind OAEs was an abrupt rise in temperature, induced by rapid influx of CO2 into the atmosphere from volcanogenic and/or methanogenic sources. Global warming was accompanied by an accelerated hydrological cycle, increased continental weathering, enhanced nutrient discharge to oceans and lakes, intensified upwelling, and an increase in organic productivity. An increase in continental weathering is typically recorded by transient increases in the seawater values of 87Sr/86Sr and 187Os/188Os ratios acting against, in the case of the Cenomanian-Turonian and early Aptian OAEs, a longer-term trend to less radiogenic values. This latter trend indicates that hydrothermally and volcanically sourced nutrients may also have stimulated local increases in organic productivity. Increased flux of organic matter favored intense oxygen demand in the water column, as well as increased rates of marine and lacustrine carbon burial. Particularly in those restricted oceans and seaways where density stratification was favored by paleogeography and significant fluvial input, conditions could readily evolve from poorly oxygenated to anoxic and ultimately euxinic (i.e., sulfidic), this latter state being geochemically the most significant. The progressive evolution in redox conditions through phases of denitrification/anammox, through to sulfate reduction accompanied by water column precipitation of pyrite framboids, resulted in fractionation of many isotope systems (e.g., N, S, Fe, Mo, and U) and mobilization and incorporation of certain trace elements into carbonates (Mn), sulfides, and organic matter. Sequestration of CO2 in organic-rich black shales and by reaction with silicate rocks exposed on continents would ultimately restore climatic equilibrium but at the expense of massive chemical change in the oceans and over time scales of tens to hundreds of thousands of years.},

	abstract = {We examine the relationships between ocean ventilation, primary production, water column anoxia, and benthic regeneration of phosphorus using a mass balance model of the coupled marine biogeochemical cycles of carbon (C) and phosphorus (P). The elemental cycles are coupled via the Redfield C/P ratio of marine phytoplankton and the C/P ratio of organic matter preserved in marine sediments. The model assumes that on geologic timescales, net primary production in the oceans is limited by the upwelling of dissolved phosphorus to the photic zone. The model incorporates the dependence on bottom water oxygenation of the regeneration of nutrient phosphorus from particulate matter deposited at the water-sediment interface. Evidence from marine and lacustrine settings, modern and ancient, demonstrates that sedimentary burial of phosphorus associated with organic matter and ferric oxyhydroxides decreases when bottom water anoxia-dysoxia expands. Steady state simulations show that a reduction in the rate of thermohaline circulation, or a decrease of the oxygen content of downwelling water masses, intensifies water column anoxia-dysoxia and at the same time increases surface water productivity. The first effect reflects the declining supply of oxygen to the deeper parts of the ocean. The second effect is caused by the enhanced benthic regeneration of phosphorus from organic matter and ferric oxyhydroxides. Sedimentary burial of organic carbon and authigenic calcium phosphate mineral (francolite), on the other hand, is promoted by reduced ocean ventilation. According to the model, global-scale anoxia-dysoxia leads to a more efficient recycling of reactive phosphorus within the ocean system. Consequently, higher rates of primary production and organic carbon burial can be achieved, even when the continental supply of reactive phosphorus to the oceans remains unchanged.},

	abstract = {Fifteen years after the discovery of major glacial/interglacial cycles in the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere, it seems that all of the simple mechanisms for lowering pCO2 have been eliminated. We use a model of ocean and sediment geochemistry, which includes new developments of iron limitation of biological production at the sea surface and anoxic diagenesis and its effect on CaCO3 preservation in the sediments, to evaluate the current proposals for explaining the glacial/interglacial pCO2 cycles within the context of the ocean carbon cycle. After equilibration with CaCO3 the model is unable to generate glacial pCO2 by increasing ocean NO3− but predicts that a doubling of ocean H4SiO4 might suffice. However, the model is unable to generate a doubling of ocean H4SiO4 by any reasonable changes in SiO2 weathering or production. Our conclusions force us to challenge one or more of the assumptions at the foundations of chemical oceanography. We can abandon the stability of the “Redfield ratio” of nitrogen to phosphorus in living marine phytoplankton and the ultimate limitation of marine photosynthesis by phosphorus. We can challenge the idea that the pH of the deep ocean is held relatively invariant by equilibrium with CaCO3. A third possibility, which challenges physical oceanographers, is that diapycnal mixing in ocean circulation models exceeds the rate of mixing in the real ocean, diminishing the model pCO2 sensitivity to biological carbon uptake.},

Although this change is thought to originate in oceanic processes2, the mechanism is still unclear. On timescales of thousands of years, the pH of the ocean (and hence the atmospheric CO2 concentration) is determined by a steady-state balance between the supply rate of calcium carbonate to the ocean from terrestrial weathering, and the alteration and removal of carbonate by burial in sediments2-4 . Degradation of organic carbon in sediments promotes the dissolution of calcium carbonate in sedimentary pore water5,6, so that a change in the relative rates at which organic carbon and calcium carbonate are deposited on the sea floor should drive a compensating change in ocean pH. Here we use a model that combines ocean circulation, carbon cycling and other sedimentary processes to explore the relationship between deep-sea-sediment chemistry and atmospheric CO2 concentration. When we include organic-carbon-driven dissolution in our model, a 40\% decrease in the calcite deposition rate is enough to decrease the atmospheric CO2 Concentration to the glacial value.},

	abstract = {Abstract Quantifying the rates of biogeochemical processes in marine sediments is essential for understanding global element cycles and climate change. Because organic matter degradation is the engine behind benthic dynamics, deciphering the impact that various forces have on this process is central to determining the evolution of the Earth system. Therefore, recent developments in the quantitative modeling of organic matter degradation in marine sediments are critically reviewed. The first part of the review synthesizes the main chemical, biological and physical factors that control organic matter degradation in sediments while the second part provides a general review of the mathematical formulations used to model these processes and the third part evaluates their application over different spatial and temporal scales. Key transport mechanisms in sedimentary environments are summarized and the mathematical formulation of the organic matter degradation rate law is described in detail. The roles of enzyme kinetics, bioenergetics, temperature and biomass growth in particular are highlighted. Alternative model approaches that quantify the degradation rate constant are also critically compared. In the third part of the review, the capability of different model approaches to extrapolate organic matter degradation rates over a broad range of temporal and spatial scales is assessed. In addition, the structure, functions and parameterization of more than 250 published models of organic matter degradation in marine sediments are analyzed. The large range of published model parameters illustrates the complex nature of organic matter dynamics, and, thus, the limited transferability of these parameters from one site to another. Compiled model parameters do not reveal a statistically significant correlation with single environmental characteristics such as water depth, deposition rate or organic matter flux. The lack of a generic framework that allows for model parameters to be constrained in data-poor areas seriously limits the quantification of organic matter degradation on a global scale. Therefore, we explore regional patterns that emerge from the compiled more than 250 organic matter rate constants and critically discuss them in their environmental context. This review provides an interdisciplinary view on organic matter degradation in marine sediments. It contributes to an improved understanding of global patterns in benthic organic matter degradation, and helps identify outstanding questions and future directions in the modeling of organic matter degradation in marine sediments.},

	abstract = {A combination of pore water and solid phase analysis was used to determine whether authigenic carbonate fluorapatite ({CFA)} is currently forming in the sediment at two locations ({OMEX} I and {II)} on the North Atlantic continental platform Goban Spur (southwest of Ireland). Results of selective P extractions suggest that an early diagenetic redistribution of Fe-bound P to an authigenic P phase may be occurring at both stations. A steady-state diagenetic model describing the depth profiles of pore water {HPO42-} and three solid phase forms of P (organic P, Fe-bound P and authigenic P) was developed and applied to the data of station {OMEX-I.} The model results indicate that {CFA} formation can account for the observed increase of authigenic P with depth at this station. Furthermore, the results show that an intense cycling of P between Fe-bound P and pore water {HPO42-} at the redox interface can create conditions beneficial for {CFA} formation. This internal P cycle is driven by downward, bioturbational transport of mainly in-situ-formed Fe-bound P into the reduced sediment zone. Losses from the internal P cycle due to {CFA} formation and {HPO42-} diffusion are compensated for by sorption of {HPO42-} released from organic matter to Fe oxides in the oxidized surface sediment. Fe-bound P thus acts as an intermediate between organic P and {CFA.} {CFA} can account for between 25 and 70\% of the total burial flux of reactive P at station {OMEX-I} and thus may act as an important sink for P in this low sedimentation, continental margin environment.},

The relationships are corrected for skewness to reduce the bias inherent in the back transformation from a lognormal to an arithmetic estimate.

Bioturbation is shown to be the dominant mode of sediment transport in the upper centimeters of oceanic sediments. The derived empirical relationships are combined with bathymetric maps to estimate globally integrated rates of benthic processes.

In this paper we use a two-layer, analytic diagenetic model applied in the North Sea coastal waters to derive simple mathematical relationships linking benthic N and P fluxes at the sediment water interface to organic matter inputs to the sediment. The two-layer, analytic diagenetic model describes organic matter mineralization, the resulting C, O2, N and P diagenetic processes and the sediment–water nutrient exchange fluxes as a function of bottom water nutrient concentration, total sediment organic matter mineralization, temperature and the sediment characteristics (porosity, tortuosity, bioturbation). The model was first verified by comparing nutrient and oxygen depth profiles and mineralization features along an eutrophication gradient with results obtained under the same conditions with a dynamic, vertically resolved model ({OMEXDIA).} The model was then applied to several stations in the North Sea characterized by different sediments and the results were compared with available data ({NO3}, {NH4}, {PO4} and O2 sediment profiles and sediment–water fluxes). Finally, we performed numerous Monte-Carlo model simulations with different parameter values to derive simplified mathematical relationships of benthic N and P fluxes at the sediment water interface.},

This has enabled us to take a novel approach in diagnosing modern marine carbon cycling: assimilating observation of the calcium carbonate (CaCO3) content of deep-sea sediments with an ensemble Kalman filter. The resulting calibrated model predicts a mean surface sediment content (32.5 wt\%) close to the observed value (34.8 wt\%), and a global burial rate of CaCO3 in deep sea sediments of 0.121 PgC yr−1, in line with recent budget estimates of 0.10−0.14 PgC yr−1. We employ the GENIE-1 model in quantifying the multimillennial-scale fate of fossil fuel CO2 emitted to the atmosphere. In the absence of any interaction between ocean and sediments, an equilibrium partitioning of CO2 is reached within ∼1000 years of emissions ceasing, with 34\% (645 ppm) remaining in the atmosphere out of a total fossil fuel burn of 4173 PgC. An additional 12\% of CO2 emissions (223 ppm) are sequestered as bicarbonate ions (HCO3−) by reaction with deep-sea carbonates (“seafloor CaCO3 neutralization”) on a timescale of ∼1.7 ka. Excess of carbonate weathering on land over deep-sea burial results in a further net transformation of 14\% of CO2 emissions (261 ppm) into HCO3− (“terrestrial CaCO3 neutralization”) on a timescale of ∼8.3 ka. We have also assessed the importance of a changing climate in modulating the stabilization of atmospheric CO2 through ocean-sediment interaction. Increased ocean stratification suppresses particulate organic carbon export, which in turn enhances seafloor CaCO3 preservation. The resulting reduction in the sequestration of fossil fuel CO2 represents a new positive feedback on millennial-scale climate change.},

	abstract = {As a contribution to the EC-OMEX-II program, sediment carbon and nitrogen budgets are presented for the Iberian Margin (northeastern Atlantic). The budgets for degradable organic carbon and associated nitrogen were calculated from sediment and pore water properties, using a steady-state version of a numerical coupled diagenetic model, OMEXDIA. Data were collected throughout the major upwelling period along five transects, four of which were located on the open margin and one positioned in a major submarine canyon, the Nazaré Canyon.

A comparison of in situ oxygen profiles measured with monocathodic microelectrodes and with Clark type microelectrodes showed that monocathodic electrodes overestimate the oxygen concentration gradient near the sediment–water interface. This artifact probably results from the loss in sensitivity of the monocathodic microelectrode during profiling. Shipboard time course measurements with Clark type electrodes demonstrated transient conditions upon sediment retrieval on deck and indicated enhanced rates of oxygen consumption in the surface sediment, presumably as a result of lysis or exudation of oxidisable substrates by infauna. As a result, oxygen fluxes calculated from shipboard oxygen profiles overestimated in situ fluxes by up to a factor of 5 for water depths \&gt;1000 m.

The sediments from the canyon and from a depositional area on the shelf were enriched in organic carbon (3–4.5 wt\%) relative to the open margin stations (0.5–2 wt\%) and showed C/N ratios exceeding Redfield stoichiometry for marine organic matter, indicating there was deposition of organic carbon of terrestrial origin in these areas. The oxidation of organic carbon on the open margin declined from {\textasciitilde}11 gCm−2y−1 on the shelf to 2 gCm−2y−1 at 5000 m water depth, and was dominated by aerobic oxidation. The reactivity of the degradable organic carbon at the time of deposition was \&lt;2.5 y−1 on the shelf, and declined to \&lt;0.5 y−1 offshore. The burial of refractory organic carbon at the stations along the open margin transects also declined with increasing water depth from {\textasciitilde}5 gCm−2y−1 on the shelf to \&lt;1 gCm−2y−1 at 2000 m depth, whereas the burial of particulate inorganic carbon declined from {\textasciitilde}20 gCm−2y−1 to \&lt;5 gCm−2y−1. A comparison of the estimated total organic carbon deposition and predicted delivery for the shelf suggest that 58 to 165 gCm−2y−1 is oxidized in the water column, laterally advected, or focused into one of the canyons.

Anaerobic oxidation, denitrification and, therefore, total oxidation of organic carbon was enhanced within the canyon relative to the open margin. Total organic carbon oxidation decreased with water depth from 22 gCm−2y−1 at the head of the canyon to 3 gCm−2y−1 over its fan. The reactivity of the organic carbon deposited in the canyon was lower than those of the shelf stations, suggesting that the canyon is being enriched in older, laterally advected organic matter. The burial of refractory organic carbon in sediments from the Nazaré Canyon was considerably higher than in the sediments from the open margin; it also decreased with depth from 20 gCm−2y−1 at 343 m to {\textasciitilde}2.5 gCm−2y−1 at 4298 m water depth. The burial of particulate inorganic carbon was slightly lower than that of refractory organic carbon.

The burial of refractory organic carbon and the deposition of degradable organic carbon were both positively correlated with the sedimentation rates for the Iberian Margin, and indicated burial efficiencies were 0.6 to 48\%. A single trend for burial efficiency versus sedimentation rate for both the canyon and the open margin indicates that the sedimentation rate was the master variable for the geographical distribution of organic carbon oxidation and carbon preservation on the NW Iberian Margin.},

	abstract = {In this paper porewater and solid phase analyses are used in combination with in situ O2 and pH microelectrode measurements to characterize early diagenetic processes in the uppermost sediments of the Santa Barbara Basin, California. Rapid reduction of dissolved oxygen, nitrate, solid phase manganese and iron, and dissolved sulfate is observed. Between sediment depths of 0 and 2 cm, reductive solubilization of ferric iron phases releases Fe2+, adsorbed phosphate, and fluoride to the porewaters and contributes to a sharp increase in porewater pH. Between 2 and 4 cm, sulfate reduction rates peak, pH levels off, and acid volatile sulfides and pyrite become the dominant forms of solid phase iron. Saturation state calculations, which depend largely on pH, indicate that the porewaters of the Santa Barbara Basin become saturated with respect to carbonate fluorapatite and calcite within the first 0.25 mm of the sediment and are highly supersaturated by and below 2 cm. In spite of this result, porewater evidence of phosphate and fluoride removal into a solid phase is observed only in the first ∼5 cm of some cores, whereas dissolved Ca profiles suggest dispersed calcite precipitation throughout the sediment column. This finding is interpreted as an indication of the nonsteady state nature of the surface reactions that may, given sufficient nucleation sites and time, lead to carbonate fluorapatite genesis in anoxic sediments. Finally, microelectrode pH profiles from two other basins in the California Borderlands are presented. These demonstrate that the porewaters of the Santa Barbara Basin are more alkaline than those of other basins. This outcome is attributed to the lack of particle mixing and a unique interplay between Fe liberation and FeS precipitation reactions in the Santa Barbara Basin.},

Our analytical approach is a modification of recently developed high-temperature, Pt-catalyzed oxidation methods; it uses chromatographic trapping of the DOC-derived CO2, followed by reduction to CH4 and flame ionization detection. Sampling experiments with nearshore sediments indicate that pore-water separation by whole-core squeezing causes artificially elevated DOC concentrations, while pore-water recovery by sectioning and centrifugation does not appear to introduce DOC artifacts. Results from a set of northwestern Atlantic continental slope cores suggest that net DOC production accounts for {\textgreater} 50\% of the organic C that is recycled at the sediment-water interface.},

Using long-term carbon cycle perturbation experiments, we test the effects of a wide range of model parameters, including whether or not the atmosphere was "short-circuited" in the carbon cycle; the sensitivity and feedback strength of temperature and run-off on carbonate and silicate weathering; different river-routing schemes; 0-D (global average) vs. 2-D (spatially explicit) weathering schemes; and the lithology dependence of weathering.

	abstract = {A simplified climate model is presented which includes a fully 3-D, frictional geostrophic (FG) ocean component but retains an integration efficiency considerably greater than extant climate models with 3-D, primitive-equation ocean representations (20 kyears of integration can be completed in about a day on a PC). The model also includes an Energy and Moisture Balance atmosphere and a dynamic and thermodynamic sea-ice model. Using a semi-random ensemble of 1,000 simulations, we address both the inverse problem of parameter estimation, and the direct problem of quantifying the uncertainty due to mixing and transport parameters. Our results represent a first attempt at tuning a 3-D climate model by a strictly defined procedure, which nevertheless considers the whole of the appropriate parameter space. Model estimates of meridional overturning and Atlantic heat transport are well reproduced, while errors are reduced only moderately by a doubling of resolution. Model parameters are only weakly constrained by data, while strong correlations between mean error and parameter values are mostly found to be an artefact of single-parameter studies, not indicative of global model behaviour. Single-parameter sensitivity studies can therefore be misleading. Given a single, illustrative scenario of CO2 increase and fixing the polynomial coefficients governing the extremely simple radiation parameterisation, the spread of model predictions for global mean warming due solely to the transport parameters is around one degree after 100 years forcing, although in a typical 4,000-year ensemble-member simulation, the peak rate of warming in the deep Pacific occurs 400 years after the onset of the forcing. The corresponding uncertainty in Atlantic overturning after 100 years is around 5 Sv, with a small, but non-negligible, probability of a collapse in the long term.},

However, a sizeable fraction of the CO2 remains in the atmosphere, awaiting a return to the solid earth by much slower weathering processes and deposition of CaCO3. Common measures of the atmospheric lifetime of CO2, including the e-folding time scale, disregard the long tail. Its neglect in the calculation of global warming potentials leads many to underestimate the longevity of anthropogenic global warming. Here, we review the past literature on the atmospheric lifetime of fossil fuel CO2 and its impact on climate, and we present initial results from a model intercomparison project on this topic. The models agree that 20–35\% of the CO2 remains in the atmosphere after equilibration with the ocean (2–20 centuries). Neutralization by CaCO3 draws the airborne fraction down further on timescales of 3 to 7 kyr.},

	abstract = {Empirical transfer functions are derived for predicting the total benthic nitrate loss (LNO3) and the net loss of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (LDIN) in marine sediments, equivalent to sedimentary denitrification. The functions are dynamic vertically integrated sediment models which require the rain rate of particulate organic carbon to the seafloor (RRPOC) and a proposed new variable (O2-NO3)bw (bottom water O2 concentration minus NO3− concentration) as the only input parameters. Applied globally to maps of RRPOC and (O2-NO3)bw on a 1° × 1° spatial resolution, the models predict a NO3− drawdown of 196 Tg yr−1 (LNO3) of which 153 – 155 Tg yr−1 is denitrified to N2 (LDIN). This is in good agreement with previous estimates using very different methods. Our approach implicitly accounts for fixed N loss via anammox, such that our findings do not support the idea that the relatively recent discovery of anammox in marine sediments might require current estimates of the global benthic marine N budget to be revised. The continental shelf (0 – 200 m) accounts for {\textgreater}50\% of global LNO3 and LDIN, with slope (200 – 2000 m) and deep-sea ({\textgreater}2000 m) sediments contributing ca. 30\% and 20\%, respectively. Denitrification in high-nitrate/low-oxygen regions such as oxygen minimum zones is significant (ca. 15 Tg N yr−1; 10\% of global) despite covering only ∼1\% of the seafloor. The data are used to estimate the net fluxes of nitrate (18 Tg N yr−1) and phosphate (27 Tg P yr−1) across the sediment-water interface. The benthic fluxes strongly deviate from Redfield composition, with globally averaged N:P, N:C and C:P values of 8.3, 0.067 and 122, respectively, indicating world-wide fixed N losses (by denitrification) relative to C and P. The transfer functions are designed to be coupled dynamically to general circulation models to better predict the feedback of sediments on pelagic nutrient cycling and dissolved O2 distributions.},

	abstract = {A chemically reactive 10-layer sediment module was coupled to a geochemical ocean general circulation model (the Hamburg Oceanic Carbon Cycle Model). The sediment model includes four solid sediment components (CaCO3, opal, organic carbon, and clay), and five pore water substances (dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, PO43−, O2, Si(OH)4) plus corresponding species containing 13C and 14C instead of 12C. The processes, namely, particle deposition, pore water reactions, pore water diffusion and interaction with the open water column, vertical sediment advection, sediment accumulation, and bioturbation, are simulated through basic parametrizations. For the water column part the Si and C cycles are coupled by a formulation of the “rain ratio” Si:C(CaCO3):C(POC), where POC is particulate organic carbon, in biogenic particle export production, with CaCO3 frustrule production growing in parallel to a weakening of opal production during progressing deficiency of dissolved silicate in the surface layer. For two preindustrial velocity fields the model reproduces major features of observed water column and sediment tracer distributions parallel to a correct preindustrial CO2 level close to 280 ppm. The model reacts sensitively to the formulation of the POC flux parametrization, the rain ratio, as well as the solubility of opal but is fairly insensitive to changes in the bioturbation rate as well as the amount of clay deposition. A simulation of the sediment distribution by use of a velocity field, which represents the ocean at conditions during the last glacial maximum, yields realistic glacial-interglacial changes for the Atlantic Ocean, while discrepancies remain for the Indo-Pacific region. A significant decrease of the atmospheric pCO2 could be achieved through an additional change of water column inventories by a change in weathering input of Si and alkalinity.},

	abstract = {Ocean biogeochemistry is a novel standard component of fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) experiments which project future climate change caused by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. Of particular interest here is the evolution of the oceanic sink of carbon and the oceanic contribution to the climate-carbon cycle feedback loop. The Hamburg ocean carbon cycle model (HAMOCC), a component of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth system model (MPI-ESM), is employed to address these challenges. In this paper we describe the version of HAMOCC used in the CMIP5 experiments (HAMOCC 5.2) and its implementation in the MPI-ESM to provide a documentation and basis for future CMIP5-related studies. Modeled present day distributions of biogeochemical variables calculated in two different horizontal resolutions compare fairly well with observations. Statistical metrics indicate that the model performs better at the ocean surface and worse in the ocean interior. There is a tendency for improvements in the higher resolution model configuration in representing deeper ocean variables; however, there is little to no improvement at the ocean surface. An experiment with interactive carbon cycle driven by emissions of CO2 produces a 25\% higher variability in the oceanic carbon uptake over the historical period than the same model forced by prescribed atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Furthermore, a climate warming of 3.5 K projected at atmospheric CO2 concentration of four times the preindustrial value, reduced the atmosphere-ocean CO2 flux by 1 GtC yr−1. Overall, the model shows consistent results in different configurations, being suitable for the type of simulations required within the CMIP5 experimental design.},

This time interval was punctuated by the Cenomanian/Turonian Oceanic Anoxic Event (OAE-2, ∼ 93.5 Myr ago), an episode of global, massive organic carbon burial that likely resulted in a large and abrupt pCO2 decline. However, the climatic consequences of this pCO2 drop are yet poorly constrained. We determined the first, high-resolution sea-surface temperature (SST) record across OAE-2 from a deep-marine sedimentary sequence at Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1276 in the mid-latitudinal Newfoundland Basin, NW Atlantic. By employing the organic palaeothermometer TEX86, we found that SSTs across the OAE-2 interval were extremely high, but were punctuated by a remarkably large cooling (5–11 °C), which is synchronous with the 2.5–5.5 °C cooling in SST records from equatorial Atlantic sites, and the “Plenus Cold Event”. Because this global cooling event is concurrent with increased organic carbon burial, it likely acted in response to the associated pCO2 drop. Our findings imply a substantial increase in the latitudinal SST gradient in the proto-North Atlantic during this period of global cooling and reduced atmospheric pCO2, suggesting a strong coupling between pCO2 and latitudinal thermal gradients under greenhouse climate conditions.},

The δ13Ccarb, δ13Corg, and δ18O chemostratigraphy of a black shale–bearing CTB succession in the Vocontian Basin of France is described and correlated at high resolution to the European CTB reference section at Eastbourne, England, and to successions in Germany, the equatorial and midlatitude proto-North Atlantic, and the U.S. Western Interior Seaway (WIS). Δ13C (offset between δ13Ccarb and δ13Corg) is shown to be a good pCO2 proxy that is consistent with pCO2 records obtained using biomarker δ13C data from Atlantic black shales and leaf stomata data from WIS sections. Boreal chalk δ18O records show sea surface temperature (SST) changes that closely follow the Δ13C pCO2 proxy and confirm TEX86 results from deep ocean sites. Rising pCO2 and SST during the Late Cenomanian is attributed to volcanic degassing; pCO2 and SST maxima occurred at the onset of black shale deposition, followed by falling pCO2 and cooling due to carbon sequestration by marine organic productivity and preservation, and increased silicate weathering. A marked pCO2 minimum (∼25\% fall) occurred with a SST minimum (Plenus Cold Event) showing {\textbackslash}textgreater4°C of cooling in ∼40 kyr. Renewed increases in pCO2, SST, and δ13C during latest Cenomanian black shale deposition suggest that a continuing volcanogenic CO2 flux overrode further drawdown effects. Maximum pCO2 and SST followed the end of OAE2, associated with a falling nutrient supply during the Early Turonian eustatic highstand.},
