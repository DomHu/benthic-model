	abstract = {Diagenesis refers to changes taking place in sediments after deposition. In a theoretical treatment of early diagenesis, Robert Berner shows how a rigorous development of the mathematical modeling of diagenetic processes can be useful to the understanding and interpretation of both experimental and field observations. His book is unique in that the models are based on quantitative rate expressions, in contrast to the qualitative descriptions that have dominated the field. In the opening chapters, the author develops the mathematical theory of early diagenesis, introducing a general diagenetic equation and discussing it in terms of each major diagenetic process. Included are the derivations of basic rate equations for diffusion, compaction, pore-water flow, burial advection, bioturbation, adsorption, radioactive decay, and especially chemical and biochemical reactions. Drawing on examples from the recent literature on continental-margin, pelagic, and non-marine sediments, he then illustrates the power of these diagenetic models in the study of such deposits. The book is intended not only for earth scientists studying sediments and sedimentary rocks, but also for researchers in fields such as radioactive waste disposal, petroleum and economic geology, environmental pollution, and sea-floor engineering.},

	abstract = {We present a numerical model of sedimentary early diagenetic processes that includes oxic and anoxic mineralization. The model belongs to the new wave of early diagenesis models that account for depth-dependent bioturbation and porosity profiles; it can be used both for calculating steady-state conditions and transient simulation. It was developed to reproduce the cycling of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen along the ocean margin; it resolves the sediment-depth profiles of carbon, oxygen, nitrate, ammonium, and other reduced substances.

Organic carbon is modeled as two degradable fractions with different first-order degradation rates and nitrogen:carbon ratios, to account for the decreasing reactivity and N/C ratio of the organic matter with depth into the sediment. The consumption of oxygen and nitrate as terminal electron acceptors is explicitly modeled, and mineralization is limited both by carbon (first order kinetics) and by oxidant availability (Michaelis-Menten type kinetics). Nitrification and oxic mineralization are decoupled, which allows the description of ammonium profiles. Mineralization processes using other oxidants (manganese oxides, iron oxides, sulphate) are lumped into one process, where degradation is only carbon limited; the terminal electron acceptors are not explicitly modeled, only the production of reduced substances is described. These substances are in part permanently removed (e.g., pyrite formation below the bioturbation zone) and partly diffuse towards the oxic layer where they react with oxygen.

The values of several parameters were constrained using literature-derived relationships. The model was calibrated on a dataset obtained from the literature, which relates the magnitude of the different pathways to total organic carbon mineralization. The influence of carbon flux, bioturbation, sedimentation rate, bottomwater concentrations of oxygen, and nitrate and carbon degradability on the different mineralization pathways is examined. The relative contribution of the oxic mineralization in the model is significantly depressed under high organic flux, under low bottomwater oxygen conditions and when the bioturbation increases; higher carbon degradability has only a small positive effect, while sedimentation rate is relatively unimportant. Denitrification is mainly influenced by the nitrate concentration in the overlying bottomwater.},

	abstract = {Abstract Quantifying the rates of biogeochemical processes in marine sediments is essential for understanding global element cycles and climate change. Because organic matter degradation is the engine behind benthic dynamics, deciphering the impact that various forces have on this process is central to determining the evolution of the Earth system. Therefore, recent developments in the quantitative modeling of organic matter degradation in marine sediments are critically reviewed. The first part of the review synthesizes the main chemical, biological and physical factors that control organic matter degradation in sediments while the second part provides a general review of the mathematical formulations used to model these processes and the third part evaluates their application over different spatial and temporal scales. Key transport mechanisms in sedimentary environments are summarized and the mathematical formulation of the organic matter degradation rate law is described in detail. The roles of enzyme kinetics, bioenergetics, temperature and biomass growth in particular are highlighted. Alternative model approaches that quantify the degradation rate constant are also critically compared. In the third part of the review, the capability of different model approaches to extrapolate organic matter degradation rates over a broad range of temporal and spatial scales is assessed. In addition, the structure, functions and parameterization of more than 250 published models of organic matter degradation in marine sediments are analyzed. The large range of published model parameters illustrates the complex nature of organic matter dynamics, and, thus, the limited transferability of these parameters from one site to another. Compiled model parameters do not reveal a statistically significant correlation with single environmental characteristics such as water depth, deposition rate or organic matter flux. The lack of a generic framework that allows for model parameters to be constrained in data-poor areas seriously limits the quantification of organic matter degradation on a global scale. Therefore, we explore regional patterns that emerge from the compiled more than 250 organic matter rate constants and critically discuss them in their environmental context. This review provides an interdisciplinary view on organic matter degradation in marine sediments. It contributes to an improved understanding of global patterns in benthic organic matter degradation, and helps identify outstanding questions and future directions in the modeling of organic matter degradation in marine sediments.},

	abstract = {A combination of pore water and solid phase analysis was used to determine whether authigenic carbonate fluorapatite ({CFA)} is currently forming in the sediment at two locations ({OMEX} I and {II)} on the North Atlantic continental platform Goban Spur (southwest of Ireland). Results of selective P extractions suggest that an early diagenetic redistribution of Fe-bound P to an authigenic P phase may be occurring at both stations. A steady-state diagenetic model describing the depth profiles of pore water {HPO42-} and three solid phase forms of P (organic P, Fe-bound P and authigenic P) was developed and applied to the data of station {OMEX-I.} The model results indicate that {CFA} formation can account for the observed increase of authigenic P with depth at this station. Furthermore, the results show that an intense cycling of P between Fe-bound P and pore water {HPO42-} at the redox interface can create conditions beneficial for {CFA} formation. This internal P cycle is driven by downward, bioturbational transport of mainly in-situ-formed Fe-bound P into the reduced sediment zone. Losses from the internal P cycle due to {CFA} formation and {HPO42-} diffusion are compensated for by sorption of {HPO42-} released from organic matter to Fe oxides in the oxidized surface sediment. Fe-bound P thus acts as an intermediate between organic P and {CFA.} {CFA} can account for between 25 and 70\% of the total burial flux of reactive P at station {OMEX-I} and thus may act as an important sink for P in this low sedimentation, continental margin environment.},

Rates of sediment accumulation, organic carbon burial, organic matter decomposition via aerobic and anaerobic pathways and bioturbation (in terms of bioturbation coefficients) can be predicted quite well using exponential relationships with water depth as an independent variable. The relationships are corrected for skewness to reduce the bias inherent in the back transformation from a lognormal to an arithmetic estimate.

Bioturbation is shown to be the dominant mode of sediment transport in the upper centimeters of oceanic sediments. The derived empirical relationships are combined with bathymetric maps to estimate globally integrated rates of benthic processes. Ocean margin sediments account for about 85\% of the materials accumulating in the ocean and about 80–90\% of the mineralization in marine sediments.},

Most existing eutrophication models lack such a description due to the complexity of diagenetic processes. In this paper we use a two-layer, analytic diagenetic model applied in the North Sea coastal waters to derive simple mathematical relationships linking benthic N and P fluxes at the sediment water interface to organic matter inputs to the sediment. The two-layer, analytic diagenetic model describes organic matter mineralization, the resulting C, O2, N and P diagenetic processes and the sediment–water nutrient exchange fluxes as a function of bottom water nutrient concentration, total sediment organic matter mineralization, temperature and the sediment characteristics (porosity, tortuosity, bioturbation). The model was first verified by comparing nutrient and oxygen depth profiles and mineralization features along an eutrophication gradient with results obtained under the same conditions with a dynamic, vertically resolved model ({OMEXDIA).} The model was then applied to several stations in the North Sea characterized by different sediments and the results were compared with available data ({NO3}, {NH4}, {PO4} and O2 sediment profiles and sediment–water fluxes). Finally, we performed numerous Monte-Carlo model simulations with different parameter values to derive simplified mathematical relationships of benthic N and P fluxes at the sediment water interface.},
