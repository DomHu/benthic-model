\begin{abstract}
Here we describe the first version of a new, analytical early diagenetic model resolving organic matter cycling and associated biogeochemical dynamics in marine sediments called OMEN-SED (Organic Matter ENabled SEDiment model). 
Most biogeochemical cycles and reactions in the surface sediments can be related either directly or indirectly to the degradation of organic matter. 
Despite its fundamental importance, an appropriate Earth System model of the coupled atmosphere-ocean-sediment system which is able to model all 
relevant processes and feedbacks over geological time-scales currently does not exist. The major problem is the high computational cost of simulating 
the essential redox reactions in marine sediments which are important to calculate burial of organic matter and benthic recycling fluxes of chemical compounds. 
In most Earth System models sediment-water dynamics are  either neglected or treated in a very simplistic way. To provide a more realistic description of organic matter 
degradation and nutrient cycles in marine sediments we have developed OMEN-SED, a new, one-dimensional, numerically efficient reactive transport model. 
OMEN-SED is the first analytical model to explicitly describe OM cycling as well as associated dynamics of the most important TEAs (i.e. O2 , NO3, SO4), 
related reduced substances (NH4, H2S), the full suite of secondary-redox reactions, macronutrients (PO4) and associated pore water quantities (ALK, DIC). 
To represent a redox-dependent sedimentary P cycle we consider the formation and burial of Fe-bound P and authigenic Ca-P minerals. 
Thus, OMEN-SED captures most of the features of a complex, numerical diagenetic model, however, its computational efficiency allows the coupling to global Earth System models 
and therefore the investigation of coupled global biogeochemical dynamics over different timescales. This paper provides a detailed description of the new sediment 
model, \textcolor{red}{tested with obersvations, SA and global observations} and describes it's coupling to the Earth System model cGENIE.

\textbf{Role of marine sediments for climate and global biogeochemical cycles:}\\
Marine surface sediments are key components in the Earth system. They host the largest carbon reservoir within the surficial Earth system, provide the only long term sink for atmospheric \chem{CO_2}, 
recycle nutrients and represent the most important geochemical archive used for deciphering past changes in biogeochemical cycles and climate  \citep[e.g.][]{berner:91, archer_effect_1994, ridgwell_role_2005, arndt_quantifying_2013}. 
Physical and chemical processes in sediments (i.e. diagenetic processes) depend on the water column and vice versa: Diagenesis is mainly donor controlled, as it is fuelled by the external supply of solid material 
(e.g. organic matter, calcium carbonate, opal) from the water column and is affected by overlying bottom water concentrations of solutes. 
At the same time, sediments impact the water column directly either by short- and long-term storage of deposited material or diagenesis transforms deposited material and returns some of the resulting products (e.g. nutrients, DIC) to the bottom waters. 
This so-called benthic-pelagic coupling is essential for understanding global biogeochemical cycles and climate \citep[e.g.][]{archer_effect_1994, archer_what_2000, soetaert_coupling_2000, mackenzie_sediments_2005}. 

Biological primary production of organic matter (OM, \chem{CH_2O} in equation \ref{eq:photosynthesis}) and the reverse process of degradation can be written in a greatly simplified reaction as:
\begin{reaction}
\chem{CO_2}+\chem{H_2O} \rightleftharpoons \chem{CH_2O} + \chem{O_2}.\label{eq:photosynthesis}
\end{reaction}
On geological timescales production of OM is generally greater than degradation which results in some organic matter being buried in marine sediments and oxygen accumulating in the atmosphere. 
Thus burial of OM leads to net oxygen input to, and \chem{CO_2} removal from the atmosphere \citep{berner_phanerozoic_2004}. 
On shorter timescales, the upper few meters of the sediments (i.e. early diagenesis) are specifically important as it is decided here if a substance is recycled to the water column or buried for a longer period of time in the 
deeper sediments \citep{hensen_benthic_2006}. 
Most biogeochemical cycles and reactions in this part of marine sediments can be related either directly or indirectly to the degradation of organic matter \citep[e.g][]{boudreau_reactive_1991, arndt_quantifying_2013}. 
Organic matter degradation releases metabolic \chem{CO_2} to the pore water, causing it to have a lower pH and provoking the dissolution of \chem{CaCO_3} \citep{emerson_carbon_1981}.
Oxygen and nitrate for instance, the most powerful electron acceptors, are consumed in the course of the degradation of organic matter, resulting in the release of ammonium and phosphorous to the pore water. 
As such, degradation of OM in the sediments can profoundly affect the oxygen and nutrient inventory of the ocean and thus primary productivity \citep{van_cappellen_benthic_1994, lenton_redfield_2000}. 
%From Soetart-review: As such, marine sediments can affect the nutrient inventory of the ocean, hence, primary productivity \citep{van_cappellen_benthic_1994}. 

% DH: more facts on sediments
%Furthermore, the sedimenst form an important sink for organic phosphorus and nitrogen. 
%Furthermore, burial of OM represents an important connection between carbon stored in more climate-relevant reservoirs like oceans, atmosphere, 
%and surficial sediments and carbon that is sequestered for much longer, geological timescales in sedimentary rock or coal \citep{mackenzie_sediments_2005, burdige_preservation_2007}. 

% \textcolor{red}{TODO include info on shelf-nutrient hypothesis:} (From Palastanga et al. 2013) 
% During  glacial  periods,  P  burial  on  shelves was likely reduced because of sea level fall, whereas the 
% erosive transfer of particulate material containing reactive P and degradable carbon from shelves to the open ocean was likely
% enhanced (Ruttenberg,1993). As a consequence, the inventory of P in the open ocean, primary productivity and CO2 
% drawdown may have increased, whereas ocean oxygen may have declined. This potential impact on productivity and CO2 
% was first brought forward by Broecker (1982) in the so-called shelf-nutrient hypothesis.

Nutrient recycling from marine sediments has been suggested to play a key role for climate and ocean biogeochemistry for different events during Earth history. 
For example, feedbacks between phosphorous storage and erosion from shelf sediments and marine productivity have been hypothesised to play an important role for glacial/interglacial atmospheric \chem{CO_2} changes \citep{broecker_ocean_1982, ruttenberg_reassessment_1993}. 
Furthermore, nutrient recycling from anoxic sediments has been invoked to explain the occurance of more extreme events in Earth history, for instance Oceanic Anoxic Events % by modelling and data studies 
\citep[OAEs, e.g.][]{mort_phosphorus_2007, tsandev_modeling_2009}. OAEs represent severe disturbances of the global carbon, oxygen and nutrient cycles of the ocean and are usually characterized 
by widespread bottom water anoxia and photic zone euxinia \citep{jenkyns_geochemistry_2010}. 
One way to explain the genesis and persistence of OAEs is increased oxygen demand due to enhanced primary productivity. Increased nutrient inputs to fuel primary productivity may have come from marine sediments as the 
burial efficiency of phosphorus declines when bottom waters become anoxic \citep{ingall_evidence_1994, van_cappellen_benthic_1994}. 
The recovery from OAE like conditions is thought to involve the permanent removal of excess \chem{CO_2} from the atmosphere and ocean by burying carbon in the form of organic matter in marine sediments 
\citep[e.g.][]{arthur_geochemical_1988, jarvis_black_2011}, which is consistent with the geological record of widespread black shale formation \citep{stein_accumulation_1986}. 
However, the overall amount, exact timing and the rate of organic matter burial remain a topic of an ongoing debate.

\textbf{Diagenetic Models:}\\
Therefore, globally quantifying the burial and degradation of organic matter in marine sediments and related biogeochemical dynamics is important for understanding 
climate and the cycling of many chemical elements on various timescales. Such studies and quantifications are possible through the application of idealised 
mathematical representations of diagenesis, or so-called diagenetic models \citep[see e.g.][]{berner_early_1980, boudreau1997diagenetic}.
The number of research questions that can be addressed with diagenetic models is infinite and a plethora of different approaches have been developed, mainly 
following two distinct directions \citep{arndt_quantifying_2013}. 

First, state-of-the art vertically resolved numerical models simulating the entire suite of essential coupled redox and equilibrium reactions within marine sediments %that control organic matter burial and benthic recycling fluxes 
(e.g. BRNS, \citeauthor{aguilera_knowledge-based_2005}, \citeyear{aguilera_knowledge-based_2005}; 
CANDI, \citeauthor{boudreau_method--lines_1996}, \citeyear{boudreau_method--lines_1996}; MEDIA, \citeauthor{meysman_reactive_2003}, \citeyear{meysman_reactive_2003}; 
STEADYSED, \citeauthor{cappellen_cycling_1996}, \citeyear{cappellen_cycling_1996}). 
These ``complete'', non-steady-state models, thus resolve the resulting characteristic redox-zonation of marine sediments through explicitly including oxic OM degradation, 
denitrification, oxidation by manganese and iron (hydr)oxides, sulphate reduction and methanogenesis as well as the reoxidation of reduced byproducts % formed during OM respiration 
(i.e. \chem{NH_4}, \chem{Mn^{2+}}, \chem{Fe^{2+}}, \chem{H_2S}, \chem{CH_4}). 
Furthermore, they incorporate various mineral dissolution and precipitation reactions, as well as fast equilibrium sorption processes for example of 
\chem{NH_4}, \chem{PO_4} and metal ions \citep[i.e. \chem{Mn^{2+}}, \chem{Fe^{2+}} and \chem{Mg^{2+}}, compare][]{cappellen_cycling_1996, meysman_reactive_2003}. 
Modelled, depth-dependent, transport processes usually comprise advection, diffusion, bioturbation and bio-irrigation.   
This group of diagenetic models generally uses a so-called multi-G approach \citep{joergensen_comparison_1978_2, berner_early_1980}, thus dividing the bulk organic 
matter pool into a number of compound classes that are characterised by different degradabilities $k_i$, which are generally dependent on the type and concentration 
of the specific terminal electron acceptor (TEA). 
These complex models have a great potential for quantifying OM degradation dynamics for sites where enough observations are available to constrain its model 
parameters \citep[see e.g.][for applications]{boudreau_comparative_1998, wang_multicomponent_1996, thullner_global_scale_2009}. 
%Combining such a complex diagenetic model with an ocean biogeochemical model results in the most realistic benthic-pelagic coupling. 
However, due to the high degree of coupled processes and depth-varying parameters the diagenetic equation needs to be %this group of diagenetic models needs to be 
solved numerically, thus resulting in a very high computational demand and consequently rendering their application in an Earth system model framework prohibitive. 
Additionally, their global applicability is limited by the restricted transferability of model parameters from one site to the global scale \citep{arndt_quantifying_2013}. 

The second group of models solves the diagenetic equation analytically or semi-analytically , thus providing an alternative and computational more efficient approach. 
However, finding an analytical solution, especially when complex reaction networks are to be considered, is not straightforward and generally requires the assumption of steady state. 
The complexity of the reaction network can be reduced by dividing the sediment column into distinct zones and accounting for the most pertinent biogeochemical processes 
within each zone, thus increasing the likelihood of finding an analytical solution. % to Eq. (\ref{eq:Eq_generaldiagenetic}) (see Eq. (\ref{eq:ODE_general_solution}) in section \ref{subsec:GBCM} for the general steady-state solution). 
In general, analytical diagenetic models are less sophisticated and comprehensive than numerical models and are used for the coupling 
to global ESMs (e.g. HAMOCC and NorESM use the model of \citet{heinze_global_1999}) or box models (e.g. DCESS, \citeauthor{shaffer_presentation_2008}, \citeyear{shaffer_presentation_2008} or 
MBM using MEDUSA, \citeauthor{munhoven_glacialinterglacial_2007}, \citeyear{munhoven_glacialinterglacial_2007}). 
These analytic or semi-analytical models  account for the most important transport processes (i.e advection, bioturbation and molecular diffusion) through basic parametrizations and 
include fewer biogeochemical reactions which are generally restricted to the upper, bioturbated 10\,cm of the sediments. 
They assume that the sedimentary organic matter pool is composed of just a single compound class which is either degraded with a globally invariant degradation rate constant 
\citep[][]{munhoven_glacialinterglacial_2007} or a fixed rate constant depending on local oxygen concentrations \citep{shaffer_presentation_2008, palastanga_long_term_2011}. 
Pore water tracers explicitly represented in DCESS \citep{shaffer_presentation_2008} and the HAMOCC model of \citet{heinze_global_1999} and \citet{palastanga_long_term_2011} 
are restricted to DIC, TA, \chem{PO_4} and \chem{O_2}. The MEDUSA model \citep{munhoven_glacialinterglacial_2007} considers \chem{CO_2}, \chem{HCO_3^-}, \chem{CO_3^{2-}} and \chem{O_2}. 
Other species produced or consumed during OM degradation are neglected. 
Thus, with oxygen being the only TEA explicitly modelled the influence of reduced species is only implicitly included in the boundary conditions for \chem{O_2}. 
A newer versions of the HAMOCC model, being a notable exception, as \citet{ilyina_global_2013} include \chem{NO_3} and denitrification explicitly. Furthermore, the version of 
\citet{palastanga_long_term_2011} represents an redox-dependent explicit sedimentary phosphorus cycle. Yet, secondary redox reactions involving reduced substances or sorption processes are not 
included in any of the discussed models. 

% From Soetart-review:  this evidence of mutual interaction between the water column and the sediment
% beneath, most biogeochemical models for water column processes either neglect the sediments or apply
% a rather crude approximation for the benthic response.

\textbf{How are sediments resolved in Earth system models:}\\
Earth system models generally track the biogeochemical dynamics of organic and inorganic carbon, essential nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus) and oxygen with the aim of investigating the evolution 
of the ocean's redox structure and carbonate system and its feedbacks on global climate. This general aim thus defines a minimum set of state variables and reaction processes that need to be resolved for an efficient 
representation of the benthic-pelagic coupling in Earth system models. A suitable sediment model has to provide a robust quantification of organic (and inorganic) carbon burial fluxes, as well as 
benthic uptake/return fluxes of oxygen, growth-limiting nutrients and reduced species. As a consequence, the reaction network must account for the most important primary and secondary redox reactions, equilibrium reactions, 
mineral precipitation/dissolution and adsorption/desorption, resulting in a complex set of coupled reaction-transport equations. 

Even though there are more appropriate sediment representations, in most current ESMs sediment-water dynamics are either neglected or treated in a very simplistic way \citep{soetaert_coupling_2000, huelse_biopump_models_2017}. 
Most Earth system Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMICs) and also some of the higher resolution global carbon cycle models represent the sediment-water interface either as a 
reflective or a conservative/semi-reflective boundary \citep{huelse_biopump_models_2017}. 
Thus, all particulate material deposited on the seafloor is either instantaneously consumed (reflective boundary), or a fixed fraction is buried in the sediments (conservative/semi-reflective boundary). 
Both highly simplified approaches furthermore completely neglect the exchange of solute species through the sediment-water interface and, therefore, cannot resolve the complex benthic-pelagic coupling. 
However, due to their computational efficiency, both representations are often used in global biogeochemical models \citep[e.g.][]{najjar_impact_2007, ridgwell_marine_2007, goosse_description_2010}. 
A superior approach is the vertically integrated dynamic model, which represents the whole sediment column as a single box \citep{huelse_biopump_models_2017}. Here, OM deposited on 
the seafloor is added to the sediment box where it gets degraded and dissolved species diffuse through the sediment-water interface in accordance with these transformations. 
This approach thus ignores the vertical extent of the sediments and the temporary storage of dissolved species \citep{soetaert_coupling_2000}. Yet, it is computationally efficient and 
allows differentiating between various fractions of organic matter. Most EMICs incorporate a vertically integrated dynamic model for particulate inorganic carbon only 
(i.e. mainly \chem{CaCO_3}) and just a few  consider oxic-only sediment degradation of organic matter \citep{huelse_biopump_models_2017}. 

The most complex description of diagenetic organic matter degradation in Earth system models is the second group of vertically resolved diagenetic models as discussed above 
\citep[e.g.][]{heinze_global_1999, munhoven_glacialinterglacial_2007, shaffer_presentation_2008}. 
These models solve the one-dimensional reaction-transport equation for a number of solid and dissolved species for the upper, bioturbated 10\,cm of the sediments. 
Examples of global ESMs employing a vertically resolved diagenetic model are NorESM \citep{tjiputra_evaluation_2013} and HAMOCC \citep{palastanga_long_term_2011, ilyina_global_2013}, 
both using a version of \citet{heinze_global_1999}. None of the EMICs reviewed by \citet{huelse_biopump_models_2017} use such a sediment representation. 
DCESS \citep{shaffer_presentation_2008} and MBM \citep{munhoven_glacialinterglacial_2007} are box models employing a vertically resolved diagenetic model. 
However, in general oxygen is the only TEA explicitly modelled and secondary redox reactions and reduced species are completely neglected in these approaches. 
Furthermore, all models represent the bulk OM pool as a single fraction with a fixed degradation rate constant. 

% Sandra review: large scale of published model parameters illustrates the complex nature of organic matter dynamics! Very difficult to find global relationships to relate model parameters 
% to available environmental characteristics, such as water depth, deposition rate. 

\textbf{Problem with that:} \\
Obviously, such a simplification of the OM pool can neither account for the observed vast structural complexity in natural organic matter and its resulting different degradation 
rates nor for the rapid decrease in OM degradability in the uppermost centimetres of the sediments \citep{arndt_quantifying_2013}. It has been suggested that at least a 3G approach 
is necessary to accurately represent organic matter dynamics in this part of the sediments where most OM is degraded \citep[e.g.][]{soetaert_model_1996}. 
Even more restrictive is the use of \chem{O_2} as the only TEA and the complete absence of reduced substances and related secondary redox reactions. 
Even though for the majority of the modern sediments (i.e. in the deep-ocean) \chem{O_2} is the primary electron acceptor and 
\citet{archer_model_2002} suggested that aerobic degradation accounts for 66\% of total organic matter respiration 
more recent model and data studies have reported that sulfate reduction is the dominant degradation pathway on a global average 
\citep[with contributions of 55-76\%][]{canfield_aquatic_2005, jorgensen_sulfur_2006, thullner_global_scale_2009}. \chem{O_2} becomes 
progressively less important as TEA with decreasing seafloor depth and in shallow waters most of it is used to reoxidise reduced substances produced during anaerobic degradation \citep{canfield_aquatic_2005, thullner_global_scale_2009}. 
Thus, the in situ production of e.g. \chem{NO_3} and \chem{SO_4} through oxidation of \chem{NH_4} and \chem{H_2S} forms an important sink for \chem{O_2} which is entirely neglected in 
current sediment representations in global models. In addition, due to the lack of an appropriate sedimentary P cycle (with the exception of the HAMOCC version of \citet{palastanga_long_term_2011}, no current global ESM is able to model 
the redox dependent P release from marine sediments and its implications for primary productivity, global biogeochemical cycles and climate. 

% Even though in the current ocean these complex interactions between different degradation pathways and redox reactions are restricted to highly productive environments these processes are getting more important for other 
% time periods with more OM burial (e.g. OAEs).


\textbf{Solution presented here:}\\
In order to provide a more realistic description of organic matter degradation and nutrient cycles in marine sediments we have developed the OrganicMatter ENabled SEDiment model (OMEN-SED), 
a new, one-dimensional, numerically efficient reactive transport model. OMEN-SED is the first analytical model to explicitly describe OM cycling as well as associated dynamics of the most important TEAs 
(i.e. \chem{O_2}, \chem{NO_3}, \chem{SO_4}), related reduced substances (\chem{NH_4}, \chem{H_2S}), the full suite of secondary-redox reactions, macronutrients (\chem{PO_4}) and associated pore water quantities (\chem{ALK}, \chem{DIC}). 
To represent a redox-dependent sedimentary P cycle we consider the formation and burial of Fe-bound P and authigenic Ca-P minerals. % two similar to the one presented in \citet{} and \citet{palastanga_long_term_2011} is 
Thus, OMEN-SED captures most of the features of a complex, numerical diagenetic model, however, its computational efficiency allows the coupling to global Earth system models and therefore the investigation of coupled global biogeochemical 
dynamics over different timescales. 
Here, the model is presented as a 2G-approach, however, a third, non-degradable OM fraction can easily be added and OMEN-SED can be further extended to a Multi-G approach.

\section{Model Description}
The following section provides a detailed description of the new model. Table \ref{table:reactions_processes} summarizes the biogeochemical reaction network and 
a glossary of parameters along with their respective units is provided in Tables \ref{table:sed-charac_transport-parameters} and \ref{table:reaction_parameters}.

\subsection {General Model Approach} \label{subsec:GeneralModelApproach}
The calculation of benthic return/uptake and burial fluxes is based on the vertically resolved conservation equation for solid and dissolved species in porous media 
\citep[e.g.][]{berner_early_1980, boudreau1997diagenetic}:

\begin{equation} 
\frac{\partial \xi C_i}{\partial t}=-\frac{\partial F}{\partial z}+\xi \sum_j R_i^j \label{eq:Eq_generaldiagenetic}
\end{equation}

where $C_i$ is the concentration of the biogeochemical species $i$, $\xi$ equals the porosity $\phi$ for solute species and $(1-\phi)$ for solid species, hence represents the partitioning of species $i$ 
into the solute and dissolved phase. The term $z$ is the sediment depth, $t$ denotes the time, $F$ summarises the transport fluxes and $\sum_j R_i^j$ represents the sum of production/consumption rates $j$ 
that affect species $i$. The reaction network accounts for the most important primary and secondary redox reactions, equilibrium reactions, mineral dissolution and precipitation, as well as adsorption 
and desorption processes that affect the explicitly resolved chemical species. 

% State-of-the-art reaction-transport models generally solve the ordinary differential equation (ODE, Eq. \ref{eq:Eq_generaldiagenetic}) numerically and thus allow to account for transient dynamics, 
% depth-varying parameters or a high degree of coupling between different chemical species \citep[e.g.][]{soetaert_model_1996, aguilera_knowledge-based_2005}. 
% Yet, numerical models are computational expensive, thus rendering their application in an Earth system model framework prohibitive. An analytical solution of equation \eqref{eq:Eq_generaldiagenetic} 
% provides an alternative and computational more efficient approach which enjoyed great popularity in the early days of diagenetic modelling and computer technology. % due to their low computational demands. 
% However, early analytical models were often very problem-specific and only considered one or two coupled species \citep[e.g.][]{berner_idealized_1964}. \textcolor{red}{(e.g. Lehrman, Berner) ?? which other pub?}
% Over the next decades, a number of more complex analytical models describing the coupled dynamics of OM degradation, TEAs and reduced substances in sediments were developed \citep[e.g.][]{billen1982modelling, goloway1982diagenetic, jahnke1982model}, 
% before the boost in computing power enabled the development of fully-coupled, multi-species, numerical models \citep[e.g.][]{van1995metal, soetaert_model_1996}.

% Finding an analytical solution to  Eq. (\ref{eq:Eq_generaldiagenetic}), especially when complex reaction networks are to be considered, is not straightforward and generally requires the assumption of steady state. 
% In addition, the complexity of the reaction network can be reduced by dividing the sediment into distinct zones and accounting for the most pertinent biogeochemical processes 
% within each zone, thus increasing the likelihood of finding an analytical solution to Eq. (\ref{eq:Eq_generaldiagenetic}) (see Eq. (\ref{eq:ODE_general_solution}) in section \ref{subsec:GBCM} for the general steady-state solution). 

In order to find an analytical solution to Eq. (\ref{eq:Eq_generaldiagenetic}), OMEN-SED assumes that benthic dynamics can be represented by a series of steady-states. 
% Because the Earth system model relevant variability in boundary conditions and fluxes is generally longer than the characteristic timescales of the reaction-transport processes, the sediment can be described by a series of pseudo steady-states. 
In addition, it divides the sediment into a bioturbated and a non-bioturbated zone defined by the constant bioturbation depth $z_{\mathrm{bio}}$ (see Fig. \ref{fig:Sediment_layers}). 
Furthermore, it accounts for the dynamic redox zonation of marine sediments by dividing the sediment into an oxic zone delineated by the oxygen 
penetration depth $z_{\mathrm{ox}}$, a denitrification zone situated between $z_{\mathrm{ox}}$ and the nitrate penetration depth $z_{\chem{NO_3}}$, 
a sulfate reduction zone situated between $z_{\chem{NO_3}}$ and the sulfate penetration depth $z_{\chem{SO_4}}$, and a methanogenic zone situated below $z_{\chem{SO_4}}$ (Fig. \ref{fig:Sediment_layers}). 
All penetration depths are dynamically calculated by the model. 
Each zone is characterised by a set of diagenetic equations that encapsulate the most pertinent reaction and transport processes in this zone (see section \ref{subsec:Transport} and \ref{subsec:ReactionNetwork} 
for more details). 

OMEN calculates and feeds back to the Earth system model the fraction of POC preserved in the sediments and the sediment-water interface fluxes of the dissolved species $C_i$ (in mol cm$^{-2}$ year$^{-1}$):
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Flux\_SWI(C_i)} = \phi \left(D_i \frac{\partial C_i(z)}{\partial z}\bigg\rvert_0 - w \left[ C_i(0) - C_i(z_\infty) \right]\right)
\end{equation}
where $w$ is the deposition rate, $D_i$ is the diffusion coefficient and $C_i(0),\ C_i(z_\infty)$ the concentration of species $i$ at the SWI and at the lower sediment boundary. 

\subsection{Transport}\label{subsec:Transport}
The model accounts for both the advective, as well as the diffusive transport of dissolved and solid species, assuming that sediment compaction is negligible (i.e. $\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z}=0$). 
The molecular diffusion of dissolved species is described via a species-specific apparent diffusion coefficient, $D_{\mathrm{mol},i}$. 
In addition, the activity of infaunal organisms in the bioturbated zone of the sediment ($z<z_{\mathrm{bio}}$) that causes random 
displacements of sediments and porewaters is simulated using a diffusive term (e.g. Boudreau,1986), with a constant bioturbation coefficient $D_{\mathrm{bio}}$ in the bioturbated zone. 
The pumping activity by burrow-dwelling animals and the resulting ventilation of tubes, the so-called bioirrigation, is encapsulated in a factor, $f_{ir}$ that enhances the molecular diffusion coefficient 
\citep[ hence, $D_{i,0}=D_{\mathrm{mol},i}\cdot f_{ir}$,][]{soetaert1996dynamic}. The flux divergence can thus be formulated as:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial F}{\partial z}=-\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\left( -\xi D_i \frac{\partial C_i}{\partial z} +\xi w C_i\right) \label{Eq_flux_divergence}
\end{equation}
where $D_i$ is the diffusion coefficient of species $i$ ($D_i=D_{i,0}+D_{\mathrm{bio}}=D_{\mathrm{mol},i}\cdot f_{ir}+D_{\mathrm{bio}}$ for dissolved species and $D_i=D_{\mathrm{bio}}$ for solid species) and $w$ is the 
deposition rate. The bioturbation coefficient $D_{\mathrm{bio}}$ is set to zero below $z_{\mathrm{bio}}$. 
%In addition, infaunnal activity ceases ($D_{\mathrm{bio}}=0$) once bottom waters become anoxic ($[\chem{O_2}] < 5$ nanomole cm$^{-3}$ ). 

\subsection{Reaction Network}\label{subsec:ReactionNetwork}
The following subsections provide a short discussion of the reaction processes included in the model and give an overview of the 
vertically resolved conservation equations and boundary conditions for solid and dissolved species in each layer. 
Table \ref{table:reactions_processes} provides a summary of the reactions and biogeochemical tracers considered in the reaction network. Table \ref{table:Reaction_Network} summarises their reaction stoichiometry 
and Table \ref{table:ReactionOverview} provides an overview of their description in the model.

\subsubsection{Organic matter or Particulate Organic Carbon (POC)}
In marine sediments, organic matter (OM) is degraded by heterotrophic activity coupled to the sequential utilisation of terminal electron acceptors. 
%, typically in the order of \chem{O_2}, \chem{NO_3^-}, \chem{Mn(VI)}, \chem{Fe(III)} and \chem{SO_4^{2-}} followed by methanogenesis and/or fermentation. 
Here, organic matter degradation is described via a 2G-model approach \citep[][and references therein]{arndt_quantifying_2013}, 
assuming that the bulk OM consists of two discrete compound classes $C_i$ characterised by specific first-order degradation rate constants $k_i$. The degradation constants are assumed independent of the nature 
of the TEA, thus invariant along the sediment column. Nevertheless, the 2G-approach allows for selective preservation of compound classes according to their reactivity, $k_i$ and, thus, accounts for the change in organic matter reactivity during burial. 
%Each compound class is degraded according to first-order kinetics. 
The conservation equation for organic matter dynamics is thus given by:

\begin{equation}
 \frac{\partial C_i}{\partial t} = 0= D_{C_i} \frac{\partial^2C_i }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial C_i }{\partial z} - k_i\cdot C_{i} \label{eq:ODE_OC}
\end{equation}
% where:
% \begin{align}
%  D_{C_i}&=D_{\mathrm{bio}} 	 &\text{if ($z\leq z_{\mathrm{bio}}$)}\\
%  D_{C_i}&=0            &\text{if ($z > z_{\mathrm{bio}}$)} 
% \end{align}
The analytical solution of Eq. \eqref{eq:ODE_OC} requires the definition of a set of boundary conditions (Table \ref{Tab:BC_OM}). 
The model assumes a known concentration/flux at the sediment-water interface and continuity across the bioturbation boundary as transport is solely advective below $z_{\mathrm{bio}}$. 
The steady-state solution follows a simple exponential decay (see section \ref{subsec:module_Structure} for details) and drives the oxygen and nutrient dynamics.

\subsubsection{Oxygen}
In marine sediments, oxygen is consumed via aerobic degradation of organic matter and a number of secondary redox reactions. 
In the oxic layer ($z<z_{ox}$), the model explicitly accounts for the aerobic degradation of OM, which consumes oxygen with a fixed \chem{O_2:C} ratio (\chem{O_2C}, Tab. \ref{table:reaction_parameters}) 
and produces ammonium, which is partially nitrified to nitrate ($\gamma_\chem{NH_4}$).
%nitrification of parts of ammonium produced in the oxic layer of the sediment. 
%Oxygen serves as the most powerful terminal electron acceptor for the heterotrophic degradation of organic carbon. In addition, the oxidation of reduced species produced through microbial activity throughout the 
%sediment column further contributes to the consumption of oxygen. The model explicitly accounts for the consumption of oxygen by heterotrophic degradation and nitrification of ammonium in the oxic layer of the sediment. 
%The nitrification of 1 mol of ammonium in the oxic layer consumes 2 mol of oxygen. 
In addition, the oxygen consumption due to oxidation of reduced species (\chem{NH_4}, \chem{H_2S}) produced in the suboxic and anoxic layers of the sediment is implicitly taken into account 
through the flux boundary condition at the dynamic oxygen penetration depth $z_{\mathrm{ox}}$. This simplification can be justified as it has been shown that these secondary redox reactions mainly occur at the oxic/suboxic 
interface \citep{soetaert_model_1996}. The factor $\frac{1-\phi}{\phi}$ accounts for the volume conversion from the solid to the dissolved phase. 
%Oxygen is described in mol\,cm$^{-3}$ liquid and conversion from the solid phase of mineralized organic matter (expressed in mol\,cm$^{-3}$ bulk sediment) to consumption of dissolved oxygen (or later nutrients) introduce 
%a factor of $\frac{1-\phi}{\phi}$, where $\phi$ is the sediment porosity. 
Oxygen dynamics are thus described by:
\begin{align} 
 \frac{\partial \chem{O_2}}{\partial t} &= 0= D_{\chem{ \chem{O_2}}}\frac{\partial^2  \chem{O_2} }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial  \chem{O_2}}{\partial z} - \frac{1-\phi}{\phi}\sum_i k_i \cdot [ \chem{O_2C} + 2 \gamma_{\chem{NH_4}} \chem{NC_i} ]\cdot C_{i}(z) \label{eq:ODE_O2_1}
\end{align}
% where:
% \begin{align}
%  D_{ \chem{O_2}}&=D_{ \chem{O_2}, 0}+D_{\mathrm{bio}}  &\text{if ($z\leq z_{\mathrm{bio}}$)}\\
%  D_{ \chem{O_2}}&=D_{ \chem{O_2}, 0}                &\text{if ($z > z_{\mathrm{bio}}$)} 
% \end{align}  
The analytical solution of Eq. \eqref{eq:ODE_O2_1} requires the definition of boundary conditions (Table \ref{Tab:BC_O2}). 
OMEN-SED assumes a known bottom water concentration and the complete consumption of oxygen at the oxygen penetration depth (or zero flux if $z_{\mathrm{ox}}=z_\infty$). 
Equal oxygen concentration and diffusive flux above ($z_{\mathrm{bio}}^-$) and below ($z_{\mathrm{bio}}^+$) the bioturbation boundary is considered. 
In addition, the model accounts for reduced species produced by anaerobic mineralization diffusing into the oxic layer from below, 
assuming that respective fractions ($\gamma_{\chem{NH_4}}$ and $\gamma_{\chem{H_2S}}$) are re-oxidised at the oxic/suboxic interface. 

% was Sandra: In addition, it imposes a flux of reduce species through the bottom of the oxic zone that is calculated by integrating organic matter degradation rate and, thus, 
%assumes a complete oxidation of these species at the oxic/suboxic interface:

\subsubsection{Nitrate and Ammonium}
%Nitrate and ammonium are described in $mol\ cm^{-3}$ liquid and a factor of $\frac{1-\phi}{\phi}$ is introduced to account for the conversion from mineralization rates to production of dissolved species. 
%To model nutrient dynamics the sediment is partitioned into two geochemical layers (oxic and suboxic)
To model nitrate and ammonium dynamics the sediment column is partitioned into two geochemical layers (oxic and suboxic), where different equations describe the biogeochemical processes. 
Above the oxygen penetration depth organic matter mineralization produces ammonium, which is partly nitrified to nitrate (the fraction $\gamma_{\chem{NH_4}}$). 
In the suboxic zone ($z>z_{\mathrm{ox}}$), oxygen concentration is zero and nitrate serves as the electron acceptor to respire organic matter, thus nitrate is consumed by denitrification and ammonium is produced. Below the nitrate 
penetration depth $z_{\chem{NO_3}}$, ammonium is still produced via OM mineralization. The model assumes that adsorption of ammonium to sediment particles is fast compared with the characteristic transport time scales. 
Thus, a constant equilibrium adsorption coefficient $K_\chem{NH_4}$ is used to parameterize the loss of dissolved \chem{NH_4} to adsorped \chem{NH_4} \citep{wang_multicomponent_1996}.
Therefore the diagenetic equations for nitrate and ammonium are given by:
\begin{align}
\intertext{1. Layer ($z \leq z_{\mathrm{ox}}$)}
 \frac{\partial NO_3^I}{\partial t} &= 0 = D_{NO_3} \frac{\partial^2NO_3^I }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial NO_3^I }{\partial z} + \gamma_{\chem{NH_4}} \frac{1-\phi}{\phi} \cdot \sum_i \chem{NC_i} \cdot k_i \cdot C_{i}(z)\label{eq:NO3_ODE1_L1}\\ %\qquad &\text{1. Layer ($z\leq z_{\mathrm{ox}}$)}\\

 \intertext{2. Layer ($z_{\mathrm{ox}} < z \leq z_{\chem{NO_3}}$)} 
\frac{\partial NO_3^{II}}{\partial t} &= 0 = D_{NO_3} \frac{\partial^2NO_3^{II} }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial NO_3^{II} }{\partial z} - \frac{1-\phi}{\phi} NO_3C \cdot \sum_i k_i \cdot C_{i}(z) \label{eq:NO3_ODE1_L2}\\
\frac{\partial \chem{NH_4}^{II}}{\partial t} &= 0 = \frac{D_{\chem{NH_4}}}{1+K_\chem{NH_4}} \frac{\partial^2\chem{NH_4}^{II} }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{NH_4}^{II} }{\partial z} \label{eq:NH4_ODE1_L2}
 \intertext{3. Layer ($z_{\chem{NO_3}} < z \leq z_\infty$)} 
\frac{\partial \chem{NH_4}^{III}}{\partial t} &= 0 = \frac{D_{\chem{NH_4}}}{1+K_\chem{NH_4}} \frac{\partial^2\chem{NH_4}^{III} }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{NH_4}^{III} }{\partial z} + \frac{1}{1+K_\chem{NH_4}}\cdot\frac{1-\phi}{\phi} \cdot \sum_i \chem{NC_i} \cdot k_i \cdot C_{i}(z)\label{eq:NH4_ODE1_L2}

% and $i \in \{$NO$_3$, NH$_4\}$. 
The boundary conditions to solve Equations \ref{eq:NO3_ODE1_L1} - \ref{eq:NH4_ODE1_L2} are summarized in Table \ref{Tab:BC_NO3+NH4}. The model assumes known bottom water concentrations 
for both species, the complete consumption of nitrate at the nitrate penetration depth (or zero flux if $z_{\chem{NO_3}}=z_\infty$) and no change in ammonium flux at $z_\infty$. It considers equal concentrations and diffusive fluxes 
at $z_{\mathrm{bio}}$ and $z_{\mathrm{ox}}$.  In addition, the re-oxidation of upward-diffusing reduced ammonium is considered in the oxic-suboxic boundary condition for nitrate and ammonium.

\subsubsection{Sulfate and Sulfide}
When nitrate is depleted, sulfate reduction is the pathway to mineralize organic matter, thus consuming sulfate (SO$_4$) and producing hydrogen sulfide (H$_2$S) until the sulfate penetration depth ($z_{\chem{\chem{SO_4}}}$). 
Sulfate and sulfide dynamics are thus described by:
\begin{align}
\intertext{1. Layer ($z \leq z_{\chem{NO_3}}$)}
 \frac{\partial \chem{SO_4}^I}{\partial t} &= 0 = D_{\chem{SO_4}} \frac{\partial^2\chem{SO_4}^I }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{SO_4}^I }{\partial z} \label{eq:SO4_ODE1_L1}\\ %\qquad &\text{1. Layer ($z\leq z_{\mathrm{ox}}$)}\\

 \intertext{2. Layer ($z_{\chem{NO_3}} < z \leq z_{\chem{SO_4}}$)} 
\frac{\partial \chem{SO_4}^{II}}{\partial t} &= 0 = D_{\chem{SO_4}} \frac{\partial^2\chem{SO_4}^{II} }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{SO_4}^{II} }{\partial z} - \frac{1-\phi}{\phi} \cdot \sum_i \chem{SO_4C} \cdot k_i \cdot C_{i}(z) \label{eq:SO4_ODE1_L2}\\

\end{align}
% where
% \begin{align}
%  D_{i}&=D_{i, 0}+D_{\mathrm{bio}} &\text{if ($z\leq z_{\mathrm{bio}}$)}\\

% and $i \in \{$SO$_4$, H$_2$S$\}$. 
To solve equations \ref{eq:SO4_ODE1_L1} - \ref{eq:H2S_ODE1_L3} the model assumes known concentrations at the sediment-water interface and continuity 
across the bioturbation depth and the nitrate penetration depth (see Table \ref{Tab:BC_SO4+H2S}). 
The re-oxidation of reduced \chem{H_2S} to \chem{SO_4} is considered in the 
oxic-suboxic boundary condition for both species, here including the methanic zone, as \chem{H_2S} is also produced during anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). 
Furthermore, sulfate is used at $z_{\chem{SO_4}}$ to oxidize methane from below and thus producing \chem{H_2S}. 
In case $z_{\chem{SO_4}}<z_\infty$, sulfate concentration is zero at $z_{\chem{SO_4}}$ and its diffusive flux must equal the amount of methane produced below; or, in case $z_{\chem{SO_4}}=z_\infty$, 
a zero flux condition for sulfate is considered. At the lower boundary $z_\infty$ zero flux of \chem{H_2S} is considered. 
%Additionally H$_2$S is produced by AOM which is considered in the flux boundary condition at $z_{\chem{SO_4}}$.

	\caption{A schematic of the sedimentary P cycle in OMEN-SED. Red numbers represent kinetic rate constants for phosphorus dynamics (compare Table \ref{table:reaction_parameters}; p$_i$ represents uptake rate of PO$_4$

\end{figure}
To model phosphorus (P) dynamics in the sediments OMEN-SED takes into account the change with depth of phosphate (PO$_4$) and iron-bound P, thereby mainly following the description of \citet{caroline_p_slomp_key_1996} 
and \citet{gypens_simple_2008}. Throughout the sediment column organic matter is mineralized resulting in a release of phosphate to the pore water. In the oxic part of the sediment, this PO$_4$ either 
diffuses upward to the water column or is adsorped to Fe oxides forming Fe-bound P (or M) \citep{slomp1998role}. In the suboxic/anoxic zone, PO$_4$ is not only produced via organic matter degradation but is 
also released from the Fe-bound P pool due to the reduction of Fe oxides. Furthermore, phosphate concentrations can become high enough in this layer for authigenic mineral formation to occur \citep{cappellen_mathematical_1988}. 
This phosphorus bound in authigenic minerals represents a permanent sink for reactive phosphorus \citep{caroline_p_slomp_key_1996}. See Figure \ref{fig:P-cycle} for a schematic overview of the sedimentary P cycle. 
As for ammonium, the adsorption of P to the sediment matrix is treated as an equilibrium processes, parameterized with dimensionless adsorption coefficients for the oxic and anoxic zone 
\citep[$K_\chem{PO_4}^{ox}$, $K_\chem{PO_4}^{anox}$][]{slomp1998role}. Therefore the diagenetic equations for phosphate are written as:
\begin{align}
\intertext{1. Layer ($z \leq z_{\mathrm{ox}}$)}
 \frac{\partial \chem{PO_4}^I}{\partial t} &= \frac{D_{\chem{PO_4}}}{1+K_\chem{PO_4}^{ox}} \frac{\partial^2\chem{PO_4}^I }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{PO_4}^I }{\partial z} + \frac{1-\phi}{\phi}\frac{1}{1+K_\chem{PO_4}^{ox}}\sum_i 
					\left( \chem{PC}_i \cdot k_i \cdot C_{i}(z) \right) \notag\\

 \frac{\partial M^I}{\partial t} &= D_{M}\frac{\partial^2M^I }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial M^I }{\partial z} + \frac{\phi}{1-\phi}k_{s}(\chem{PO_4}^I-\chem{PO_4}^s)\label{eq:M_ODE_L1}\\  
 \intertext{2. Layer ($z_{\mathrm{ox}} < z$)} 
 \frac{\partial M^{II}}{\partial t} & = D_{M}\frac{\partial^2M^{II} }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial M^{II} }{\partial z} - k_{m}(M^{II} - M^\infty)\label{eq:M_ODE_L2}\\  
 \frac{\partial \chem{PO_4}^{II}}{\partial t} &= \frac{D_{\chem{PO_4}}}{1+K_\chem{PO_4}^{anox}} \frac{\partial^2\chem{PO_4}^{II} }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{PO_4}^{II} }{\partial z} + \frac{1-\phi}{\phi} \frac{1}{1+K_\chem{PO_4}^{anox}}\sum_i

					& - \frac{k_{a}}{1+K_\chem{PO_4}^{anox}}(\chem{PO_4}^{II}-\chem{PO_4}^a) + \frac{(1-\phi)}{\phi}\frac{k_{m}}{1+K_\chem{PO_4}^{anox}}(M^{II}-M^\infty)\label{eq:PO4_ODE_L2}\\
\end{align}

The boundary conditions to solve Equations \ref{eq:PO4_ODE_L1} - \ref{eq:PO4_ODE_L2} are summarized in Table \ref{Tab:BC_PO4+M}. 
The model assumes known bottom water concentrations and equal concentrations and diffusive fluxes at $z_{\mathrm{bio}}$ and $z_{\mathrm{ox}}$ for both species. 
Additionally it considers no change in phosphate flux and an assymptotic Fe-bound P concentration at $z_\infty$. \\

\subsubsection{Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC)}
Organic matter degradation produces dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) with a stoichiometric DIC:C ratio of 1:2 in the methanic zone and 1:1 in the rest of the sediment column. 
DIC dynamics in OMEN-SED are thus described by equations \ref{eq:DIC_ODE1_L1} and \ref{eq:DIC_ODE1_L1} and boundary conditions as summarized in Table \ref{Tab:BC_DIC}. 
The model assumes a known DIC concentration at the sediment-water interface, a zero flux condition at the lower boundary $z_\infty$ and continuity across the bioturbation and sulfate penetration depth. 
In addition, the anaerobic oxidation of methane at $z_{\chem{SO_4}}$ produces DIC (with 1:1 stoichiometry) which is accounted for through the flux boundary condition 
at $z_{\chem{SO_4}}$ (Table \ref{Tab:BC_DIC} eq. 5)

\begin{align}
\intertext{1. Layer ($z \leq z_{\chem{SO_4}}$)}

\subsubsection{Alkalinity}
Organic matter degradation and secondary redox reactions exert a complex influence on alkalinity with opposite effects depending on the TEA involved \citep{wolf-gladrow_total_2007}. 
%The dynamics are further complicated by the influence of secondary redox reactions. 
To model alkalinity in OMEN-SED the sediment column is partitioned into four geochemical layers, where different equations describe the biogeochemical processes using variable stoichiometric coefficients 
(compare Tables \ref{table:reaction_parameters} and \ref{table:Reaction_Network}). 
Above $z_{\mathrm{ox}}$, the combined effects of \chem{NH_4} and \chem{P} release due to aerobic OM mineralization increases alkalinity according to $\chem{ALK}^\mathrm{OX}$ 
whereas nitrification decreases alkalinity with stoichiometry $\chem{ALK}^\mathrm{NIT}$. 
In the remaining three zones anaerobic OM mineralization increases alkalinity with variable stoichiometric coefficients (i.e. $\chem{ALK}^\mathrm{DEN}$, $\chem{ALK}^\mathrm{SUL}$, $\chem{ALK}^\mathrm{MET}$). 
Thus, the diagenetic equations for alkalinity are written as:
\begin{align}
 \intertext{1. Layer ($z \leq z_{\chem{ox}}$)} 
\frac{\partial \chem{ALK}^{I}}{\partial t} &= 0 = D_{\chem{ALK}} \frac{\partial^2\chem{ALK}^{I} }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{ALK}^{I} }{\partial z} \notag\\
					  & + \frac{1-\phi}{\phi} \cdot \sum_i \left( \chem{ALK}^\mathrm{NIT} \cdot \frac{\gamma_{\chem{NH_4}}}{1+K_\chem{NH_4}} \chem{NC_i} + \chem{ALK}^\mathrm{OX}\right)\cdot k_i \cdot C_{i}(z) \label{eq:ALK_ODE1_L1}\\
 \intertext{2. Layer ($z_{\chem{ox}} < z \leq z_{\chem{NO_3}} $)} 
\frac{\partial \chem{ALK}^{II}}{\partial t} &= 0 = D_{\chem{ALK}} \frac{\partial^2\chem{ALK}^{II} }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{ALK}^{II} }{\partial z} + \frac{1-\phi}{\phi} \cdot \sum_i \chem{ALK}^\mathrm{DEN}\cdot k_i \cdot C_{i}(z)\label{eq:ALK_ODE1_L2}
 \intertext{3. Layer ($z_{\chem{NO_3}} < z \leq z_{\chem{SO_4}} $)} 
\frac{\partial \chem{ALK}^{III}}{\partial t} &= 0 = D_{\chem{ALK}} \frac{\partial^2\chem{ALK}^{III} }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{ALK}^{III} }{\partial z} + \frac{1-\phi}{\phi} \cdot \sum_i \chem{ALK}^\mathrm{SUL}\cdot k_i \cdot C_{i}(z)\label{eq:ALK_ODE1_L3}
 \intertext{4. Layer ($z_{\chem{SO_4}} < z \leq z_{\infty} $)} 
\frac{\partial \chem{ALK}^{IV}}{\partial t} &= 0 = D_{\chem{ALK}} \frac{\partial^2\chem{ALK}^{IV} }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{ALK}^{IV} }{\partial z} + \frac{1-\phi}{\phi} \cdot \sum_i \chem{ALK}^\mathrm{MET}\cdot k_i \cdot C_{i}(z)\label{eq:ALK_ODE1_L4}
\end{align}
To solve equations \ref{eq:ALK_ODE1_L1} - \ref{eq:ALK_ODE1_L4} the model assumes a known concentration at the sediment-water interface and continuity 
across the bioturbation depth and the penetration depths of \chem{O_2}, \chem{NO_3} and \chem{SO_4} (see Table \ref{Tab:BC_ALK}). 
The decrease of alkalinity due to oxidation of reduced species produced in the suboxic and anoxic layers (with stoichiometry 
$\chem{ALK}^\mathrm{NIT}$ and $\chem{ALK}^\mathrm{H_2S}$) is implicitly taken into account 
through the flux boundary condition at $z_{\mathrm{ox}}$ (Table \ref{Tab:BC_ALK} Eq. 5). 
Furthermore, the oxidation of methane by sulphate reduction increases alkalinity with stoichiometry $\chem{ALK}^\mathrm{AOM}$ which is accounted for through the flux boundary condition 
at $z_{\chem{SO_4}}$ (Table \ref{Tab:BC_ALK} eq. 9). At the lower boundary $z_\infty$ a zero flux condition is applied.

\subsection{Model Parameters}
This section describes the parameters used in OMEN-SED to describe sediment transport and biogeochemical reactions related to the burial and mineralization of organic matter under a wide range of environmental conditions. 
Table \ref{table:sed-charac_transport-parameters} states the parameters for sediment characteristics and table \ref{table:reaction_parameters} summarizes the stoichiometric factors and 
secondary reaction parameters used in the model.

\subsubsection{Transport Parameters}
Advection is the bulk flow of sediments and can be directly related to the accumulation of new material on the seafloor \citep[i.e. sedimentation,][]{burdige2006geochemistry}. 
This results in a downward flux of older sediment material and porewater in relation to the sediment-water interface. When coupled to an ocean model, its sedimentation flux can be readily used in OMEN-SED. 
The stand-alone version of OMEN-SED uses the empirical global relationship between sediment accumulation rate (cm yr$^{-1}$) and seafloor depth (m) of \citet{middelburg_empirical_1997}: 
\begin{equation}
 w = 3.3\cdot 10^{-0.87478367-0.00043512\cdot \text{depth}}\label{eq:sedimentation_rate},
\end{equation}
As discussed before (Sec. \ref{subsec:Transport}), the diffusion coefficient of species $i$ is calculated as $D_i=D_{i,0}+D_{\mathrm{bio}}=D_{\mathrm{mol},i}\cdot f_{ir}+D_{\mathrm{bio}}$ for dissolved species and $D_i=D_{\mathrm{bio}}$ for solid species. 
The bioturbation coefficient $D_{\mathrm{bio}}$ (cm$^2$ yr$^-1$) is constant in the bioturbated zone and also follows the empirical relationship by \citet{middelburg_empirical_1997}:
\begin{equation}
 D_{\mathrm{bio}} = 5.2\cdot 10^{0.76241122-0.00039724\cdot \text{depth}}\label{eq:bioturbation_coeff}
\end{equation}
Studies showed that bioturbational effects on a global scale are largely restricted to the upper 10 cm of the sediments and are only marginally related to seafloor depth \citep[e.g.][]{boudreau_mean_1998, teal_global_2010}. 
Therefore, OMEN-SED imposes a globally invariant bioturbation depth $z_{\mathrm{bio}}$ of 10 cm. In case the bottom water oxygen concentration is below 5 nanomole cm$^{-3}$ 
infaunnal activity is assumed to cease and $z_{\mathrm{bio}} = 0.01$ cm. 

Bioirrigation can enhance the molecular diffusion coefficient $D_{i,0}=D_{\mathrm{mol},i}\cdot f_{ir}$ \citep{soetaert1996dynamic}. However, here we do not consider this effect 
and set $f_{ir}$ to a constant value of 1. The specific molecular diffusion coefficients $D_{\mathrm{mol},i}$ are corrected for sediment porosity $\phi$, tortuosity F and are linearly interpolated for an ambient temperature $T$ using zero-degree 
coefficients $D^0_i$ and temperature-dependent diffusion coefficients $D^T_i$ \citep[compare ][]{gypens_simple_2008}:
\begin{equation*}
 D_{\mathrm{mol},i} = (D^0_i + D^T_i \cdot T )\cdot \frac{1}{\phi\cdot F}
\end{equation*}
Tortuosity can be expresssed in terms of porosity as $F = \frac{1}{\phi^m}$ \citep{ullman_diffusion_1982} with the exponent $m$ varying according to the type of sediment (here we use m=3). 
%\textcolor{red}{in matlab: $\phi^{tort-1}$; but see Gypens et al. (2008) the exponent is a parameter m not tortuosity...??}
Values for $D^T_i$ and $D^0_i$ are summarized in Table \ref{table:sed-charac_transport-parameters} and are adapted from \citet{Li_diffusion_1974} and \citet{gypens_simple_2008}.

\subsubsection {Reaction Parameters and Stoichiometries}
%The parameters relating to organic matter %The overall reactions implemented in OMEN-SED are listed in Table \ref{table:reactions_processes}. 
The applied 2G-approach for organic matter degradation considers specific degradation rate constants $k_i$ (yr$^{-1}$) for each compound class 
which are assumed invariant along the sediment column and therefore independent of the nature of the terminal electron acceptor. The rate constants can be 
altered manually to fit observed sediment profiles (compare Section \ref{subsec:SedProfiles}) or related to a master variable 
(e.g. sedimentation rate or POC-flux) provided by a coupled Earth system model (compare Section \ref{subsubsec:ESM_coupling} and \ref{subsec:GENIE-pre-ind}). 
The rate constants for P related processes (i.e. sorption of \chem{PO_4} to Fe oxides, release of \chem{PO_4} from Fe-bound P 
due to Fe-oxide reduction and authigenic CFA precipitation) are $k_s,\ k_m,\ k_a$ respectively. 
The pore water equilibrium concentrations for P sorption and CFA precipation ($\chem{PO_4}^s$, $\chem{PO_4}^a$ ) and the asymptotic concentration for Fe-bound P ($\chem{M}^\infty$ ) 
are taken from \citet{caroline_p_slomp_key_1996} \textcolor{red}{maybe change to \citet{palastanga_long_term_2011}...}.
The stoichiometry of organic matter is represented by the factors \chem{NC_i} and \chem{PC_i} denoting the molecular nitrogen to carbon and phosphorus to carbon ratio. 
In the sulfidic and methanic zone the 
reduction of 1 mol organic matter additionally produces $\chem{SO_4C}=\frac{138}{212}$ mol of hydrogen sulfide and \chem{MC} = 0.5 mol of methane. 
In the total sediment column organic matter mineralization consumes the specific TEA with a fixed ratio (\chem{O_2C}, \chem{NO_3C} and \chem{SO_4C} respectively). 
See Table \ref{table:reaction_parameters} for a complete summary of the parameters and their values.
% \textcolor{red}{Or bit longer:}\\
% In the sulfidic and methanic zone the 
% reduction of 1 mol organic matter additionally produces 0.5 mol of hydrogen sulfide (\chem{SO_4C}) and 0.5 mol of methane (\chem{MC}) respectively. 
% In the oxic part of the sediments 1 mol of oxygen is needed to mineralize 1 mol of organic matter (\chem{O_2C}). In the nitrate and sulfate reduction zone 1 mol of organic matter is reduced by 
% 0.8906 mol of nitrate (\chem{NO_3C}) and 0.5 mol of sulfate (\chem{SO_4C}) respectively. \\
%\textcolor{red}{Next bit from Gypens:} Re-oxidation occurs in a ratio of 1 mol of oxygen per mol of carbon anoxically mineralized. Similarly, 2 mol of oxygen
%are consumed during nitrification of \chem{NH_4} produced in the anoxic zone. As nitrification may be incomplete in the oxic layer, we similarly allow for part of the ammonium flux to escape re-oxidation.

\subsection{Module Structure}\label{subsec:module_Structure}
An analytical steady-state solution is found for the reaction-transport equation of each chemical species for every layer. 
At each boundary (i.e. $z_{\mathrm{ox}}, z_{\mathrm{bio}}, z_{\chem{NO_3}}$ and $z_{\chem{SO_4}}$) the model has to match continuity and flux for the 
ODE solutions of the layer above and below the specific boundary. 
In particular the bioturbation boundary is problematic as it can theoretically occur in any geochemical layer (compare Fig. \ref{fig:Boundary_matching_algo}). 
In order to simplify this recurring boundary matching problem it is implemented in an independent algorithm 
which is described in Section \ref{subsec:GBCM}. Instructions and requirements for coupling OMEN-SED to a global Earth Sytem Model are given in Section \ref{subsubsec:ESM_coupling}.

\subsubsection{Generic Boundary Condition Matching (GBCM)}\label{subsec:GBCM}
A general steady-state advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) diagenetic equation looks like:
\begin{align} 
 \frac{\partial C}{\partial t} &= 0 = D\frac{\partial^2C }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial C }{\partial z} - \sum_i \alpha_i \exp(-\beta_i z) - k\cdot C + Q.
\end{align}
where $z$ is the sediment depth, $t$ the time, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient and $w$ is the advection rate.\\
The ODE solution is of the general form:
\begin{align}
 C(z) &= A \exp(az) + B  \exp(bz) + \sum_i \frac{\alpha_i}{D \beta_i^2-w\beta_i-k}\cdot \exp(-\beta_i z) + \frac{Q}{k} \label{eq:ODE_general_solution}
\end{align}
and can therefore be expressed as:
\begin{align}
C(z) = A \cdot E(z) + B \cdot F(z) + G(z) 
\end{align}
where $E(z)$, $F (z)$ are the homogeneous solutions of the ODE, G(z) the particular integral, and A, B are the integration constants (compare Fig. \ref{fig:Boundary_matching_algo} for the whole sediment column).\\[1em]
Each boundary matching problem involves matching continuity and flux for the two solutions $C_U(z)$ (= 'upper') and $C_L(z)$ (= 'lower') across a boundary at $z = z_b$. Therefore, we get two ODE solutions of the genral form:
\begin{align}
C_U(z) &= A_U \cdot E_U(z) + B_U \cdot F_U(z) + G_U(z) \label{ODE_solution_U}\\
C_L(z) &= A_L \cdot E_L(z) + B_L \cdot F_L(z) + G_L(z) .\label{ODE_solution_L}
\end{align}
The two boundary conditions are: for continuity (where for generality we allow a discontinuity $V_b$) 
\begin{align}
  C_U(z_b) &= C_L(z_b) + V_b	\\
\intertext{and for flux}
 D_U C_U'(z_b) + wC_U(z_b) &=  D_LC_L'(z_b) + wC_L(z_b) + F_b
\end{align}
where $w$ is advection, $D$ are the diffusion coefficients and $F_b$ is any flux discontinuity.\\[1em]
In terms of the ODE solutions (\ref{ODE_solution_U}), (\ref{ODE_solution_L}), the boundary conditions represent two equations connecting the four integration constants:\\
\begin{equation}
 \begin{pmatrix} E_U & F_U \\ D_UE_U' & D_UF_U' \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} A_U \\ B_U \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} E_L & F_L \\ D_LE_L' & D_LF_L' \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} A_L \\ B_L \end{pmatrix} 
 + \begin{pmatrix} G_L - G_U + V_b \\ D_LG_L' - D_UG_U' + F_b - wV_b\end{pmatrix} \label{Solution_BC}
\end{equation}
where the ODE solutions $E,\ F,\ G$ are all evaluated at $z_b$.\\[1em]
Equation (\ref{Solution_BC}) can be solved to give $A_U$ and $B_U$ as a function of the integration constants from the layer below ($A_L$ and $B_L$), thereby constructing a piecewise solution for both layers, 
with just two integration constants. \\[1em] % $A_L$ and $B_L$. \\[1em]
In the code the function \textsf{\textbf{benthic\_utils.matchsoln}} provides this solution in the form:
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix} A_U \\ B_U \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} c_1 & c_2 \\ c_3 & c_4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} A_L \\ B_L \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} d_1 \\ d_2 \end{pmatrix} . \label{Solution_matchsoln} 
\end{equation}
Using (\ref{Solution_matchsoln}) we can now rewrite $C_U(z)$ in (\ref{ODE_solution_U}) as a function of $A_L$ and $B_L$:
\begin{equation*}
 C_U(z) = (c_1 A_L + c_2 B_L + d_1) \cdot E_U(z) + (c_3 A_L + c_4 B_L + d_2) \cdot F_U(z) + G_U(z) 
\end{equation*}
and hence define the ``transformed'' basis functions $E_U^*(z),\ F_U^*(z),\ G_U^*(z)$ such that:
\begin{equation}
 C_U(z) = A_L \cdot E_U^*(z) + B_L \cdot F_U^*(z) + G_U^*(z) \label{Solution_Upper_transformed_basis_fct}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align}
 E_U^*(z) &= c_1 E_U(z) + c_3 F_U(z) \notag\\
 F_U^*(z) &= c_2 E_U(z) + c_4 F_U(z) \label{Solution_NEW_EFG}\\
 G_U^*(z) &= G_U(z) + d_1 E_U(z) + d_2 F_U(z) \notag
\end{align}
(in the code this is done by \textsf{\textbf{benthic\_utils.xformsoln}}).

%\subsubsection*{Application in the model}\label{subsubsec:GBCM-Appl}

\subsubsection*{Solving the sediment layer stack}
Equations (\ref{Solution_matchsoln}), (\ref{Solution_Upper_transformed_basis_fct}) and (\ref{Solution_NEW_EFG}) can now be applied for each layer boundary, working up from the bottom of the sediments. 
The net result is a piecewise solution of the whole sediment column with just two integration constants (coming from the lowest layer), which can then be solved for by applying one boundary condition for the sediment-water interface 
and one for the bottom of the sediments (e.g. a concentration condition at the SWI and a zero flux condition at $z_\infty$). 
% The key point here is that this is now an algorithm (rather than a fully-worked-out algebraic solution), which only ever has to solve a two-simultaneous-equation problem as above.

\subsubsection*{Abstracting out the bioturbation boundary}
The bioturbation boundary affects the diffusion coefficient of the modelled solutes and the conservation equation of organic matter. % which is available for mineralization. 
The boundary is particularly inconvenient as it can, in principle, occur in the middle of any ``geochemical'' layer and therefore generates multiple cases (compare Fig. \ref{fig:Boundary_matching_algo}). 
To simplify this for solutes, the GBCM algorithm above is used to construct a piecewise solution and to abstract out the bioturbation boundary. 
An initial test for each ``geochemical'' layer is made to identify its ``bioturbation-status'' (fully bioturbated, fully non-bioturbated or crossing the bioturbation boundary) and (if needed) a piecewise solution is 
constructed by matching boundary conditions across the bioturbation boundary. 
The ``outside'' code therefore never needs to know whether it is dealing with a piecewise solution (i.e. matched across a bioturbation boundary) or a ``simple'' solution (i.e. the layer is fully bioturbated
or fully non-bioturbated).

In the code, this is performed by \textsf{\textbf{zTOC.prepfg\_l12}} which hands back a structure \textsf{ls} containing the ``bioturbation-status'' for each layer and (if needed) 
the description of the piecewise solution (coeffcients $c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, d_1, d_2$ as above). 
For example in the case of sulfate, \textsf{\textbf{zTOC.prepfg\_l12}} is called three times before the actual profile is calculated (once per layer: oxic, suboxic, sulfidic) 
and hands back three structures \textsf{ls} with information about the layer's ``bioturbation-status'' and all associated conditional logic. %, abstracting away the bioturbation boundary
When calculating the solutions for the different layers, the pre-calculated structure \textsf{ls} is passed to the function \textsf{\textbf{zTOC.calcfg\_l12}} which sorts out the correct
solution type to use.

\end{figure}

The coupling of OMEN-SED to the carbon-centric version of the ``GENIE'' Earth system model \citep[cGENIE][]{ridgwell_marine_2007} is described  (Fig. \ref{fig:OMEN-GENIE-coupling}). 
Results from pre-industrial experiments are presented in Section \ref{subsec:GENIE-pre-ind}. 
%cGENIE Earth System model is described, in particular its incorporation into the sediment geochemistry model \citep[SEDGEM,][]{ridgwell_regulation_2007}. 
cGENIE is a model of Intermediate Complexity based on the efficient climate model ``C-GOLDSTEIN''  of \citet{edwards_uncertainties_2005}, featuring a frictional-geostrophic 3D-ocean circulation model coupled to a fast 
Energy-Moisture Balance 2D-atmosphere together with a dynamic-thermodynamic sea-ice component. 
The version of cGENIE used here includes the marine geochemical cycling of carbon, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur \citep{ridgwell_marine_2007}, 
preservation of carbonates in deep-sea sediments \citep{ridgwell_regulation_2007} and terrestrial weathering \citep{colbourn_rock_2013}. 
The ocean model is implemented on a 36$\times$36 equal-area horizontal grid with 16 vertical levels using the pre-industrial continental configuration and bathymetry as in \citet{archer_atmospheric_2009}. 
In contrast to \citet{archer_atmospheric_2009} the same grid resolution (36$\times$36) is used for the sediment geochemistry model SEDGEM. 
Instead of completely degrading POC at the seafloor, OMEN-SED is called by SEDGEM for each wet ocean grid point. 
Depending on the overlying biogeochemical ocean model, processes can be included or excluded in OMEN-SED and stoichiometric factors need to be adjusted to ensure preservation of mass. 
As nitrogen is not modelled explicitly in the employed cGENIE configuration the related stoichiometries in OMEN-SED are set to zero (i.e. \chem{NC_i}, $\chem{ALK}^\mathrm{NIT}$ and $\chem{ALK}^\mathrm{DEN}$). 
cGENIE, however, implicitly includes the effects of \chem{NH_4} release and its nitrification on Alkalinity and neglects the impact of P release; therefore, related 
stoichiometries are changed to $\chem{ALK}^\mathrm{OX} = -16/106$ and $\chem{ALK}^\mathrm{SUL} = 122/106$.

Several biogeochemical tracers and parameters are transferred from SEDGEM to OMEN-SED and have to be converted into the required units. 
Bottom water concentrations of solutes are converted from mol\,kg$^{-1}$ to mol\,cm$^{-3}$ and the depositional flux of POC (\chem{POC_{flux}}) is converted from cm$^{3}$\,cm$^{-2}$\,yr$^{-1}$ 
to mol\,cm$^{-2}$\,yr$^{-1}$ assuming an average density of POC of 1.0\,cm$^{3}$\,g$^{-1}$.
Other parameters used from cGENIE are seafloor depth, local temperature and the partitioning of bulk POC into the slower and faster degrading pool 
(as cGENIE represents a labile and a refractory POC fraction, see \citet{ridgwell_marine_2007}). 
%For bottom water oxygen concentrations below 5 $\mu$mol kg$^{-1}$ the bioturbation depth is changed from 10 to 0.01 cm to account for the reduced presence of organisms under anoxia.  
The advection/sediment accumulation rate is generally taken from cGENIE, however, a minimum value of $w=0.5$\,cm\,kyrs$^{-1}$ is imposed as OMEN-SED tends to be unstable for lower values. 
The bulk \chem{POC_{flux}} is seperated into the labile and refractory component and the routine to calculate the sedimentary POC profiles is called. 
Here, the two POC depositional fluxes are first converted into SWI concentrations (in mol\,cm$^{-3}$) by solving Eq. (\ref{Eq_flux_divergence}) for z=0. 
OMEN-SED computes the resulting SWI-fluxes of solutes (in mol\,cm$^{-2}$\,yr$^{-1}$) and the fraction of POC preserved in the sediment at a depth of 100 cm (\chem{POC_{pres}}) and returns the 
results to cGENIE. In case no POC is deposited on the seafloor (i.e. $\chem{POC_{flux}}=0$), OMEN-SED is not called and the SWI-fluxes of solutes and \chem{POC_{pres}} are set to zero.
In order to reduce memory requirements the sediment profiles (e.g. as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:Sediment_profiles}) are not calculated in the FORTRAN version of OMEN-SED, 
however, the boundary conditions are saved at the end of the experiment and sediment profiles for specific grid-cells, ocean basins and/or ocean transects can be plotted 
using the stand-alone matlab version of OMEN-SED. 


% For the solutes this is trivial; the OM flux is converted into a concentration (\chem{POC_{con}}, in mol\,cm$^{-3}$) using the sediment accumulation rate from cGENIE ($w$, in $\frac{cm}{yr}$) as:
% \begin{equation}
%  \chem{POC_{con}} = \frac{1}{12}\cdot(1-\phi)\cdot \frac{\chem{POC_{flux}}}{w}
% \end{equation}
% where $\phi$ is the sediment porosity (-) and $\frac{1}{12}$ is the conversion of POC from $cm^3$ to $mol$ assuming the average density of POC as $1.0 \frac{cm^3}{g}$ .


\section {Model Applications}
To validate our approach, model results were compared with observed pore water profiles (Section \ref{subsec:SedProfiles}), an extensive sensitivity analysis for the most important model 
parameters was performed and resulting sediment-water interface fluxes were compared with a global database (Section \ref{subsec:SA}). Furthermore, OMEN-SED was coupled to the cGENIE Earth system model 
and different published parameterisations for the OM degradation rate constants are tested on a global scale (Section \ref{subsec:GENIE-pre-ind}).

\subsection{Sediment profiles}\label{subsec:SedProfiles}
Modelled profiles were compared with measured pore water data from different ocean depths (Figure \ref{fig:Sediment_profiles}) including the continental shelf (108\,m), upper slope (585\,m), lower slope (2213\,m) 
and the deep sea (4298\,m). The site at 585\,m depth located in the Santa Barbara Basin is characterised by anoxic bottom waters and high POC concentrations 
\citep[POC $\sim$5.5\,wt\%,][]{reimers_porewater_1996}, whereas the other sites at the Iberian margin (108 and 2213 m) and the Nazar\'e Canyon \citep[4298 m, ][]{epping_oxidation_2002} 
are oxic. 
Sediment-water interface characteristics and concentrations of POC and dissolved species in OMEN-SED were set to the observed values where available (Table \ref{table:Profiles_BC}). 
The POC and pore water profiles were fitted by optimizing the POC partitioning into the fast and slow degrading pool and their respective first order degradation rate constants (priority given to reproduce the POC and \chem{O_2} profiles). 
For phosphorus the equilibrium concentration for authigenic P formation (\chem{PO_4^a}) was adjusted to fit the \chem{PO_4} concentration at $z_\infty$. 
For the two open Iberian margin stations (108 and 2213 m) OMEN-SED fits all observations well. OMEN-SED does especially well at depth 2213m by reproducing the deep \chem{O_2} penetration and the subsurface maximum in \chem{NO_3} 
concentration due to the nitrification of \chem{NH_4}. 
For the Santa Barbara basin (585 m) a misfit is observed for \chem{H_2S} and \chem{PO_4} in the upper 20 cm of the sediment. This can be explained by the presence of \chem{Mn^{2+}}, \chem{Fe^{2+}} and dissolved \chem{Fe} at this site which 
are either reduced to degrade POC and/or react with \chem{H_2S} to form iron sulfides, therefore inhibiting the rise in concentration of \chem{H_2S} \citep{reimers_porewater_1996}. 
Phosphorus is adsorbed to \chem{Fe} oxides and incorporated into carbonate fluorapatite (\chem{CFA}) which is highly parameterised in OMEN-SED and not modelled explicitly.

For the Naza\'e Canyon station (4298\,m) satisfactory fits could be realised apart from \chem{NH_4}. However, also the original study \citep{epping_oxidation_2002} had the same problem using a more 
complex diagenetic model and suggested non-local solute exchange being responsible for the higher \chem{NH_4} concentrations at this site.

\subsection{Sensitivity Analysis}\label{subsec:SA}
Model parameters implicitly account for processes not explicitly described, they are notoriously difficult to constrain and a source of uncertainty for numerical and analytical models. 
One strategy to explore and quantify this model uncertainty that can always be applied is sensitivity analysis (SA). SA is a term used for mathematical 
techniques to investigate how the variations in the outputs ($y_1,\ ...,\ y_N$) of a model can be attributed to variations in the different input parameters ($x_1,\ ...,\ x_M$) \citep{pianosi_sensitivity_2016}. 
Different types of sensitivity indices, which quantify this relative influence with a scalar $S_i$, can be calculated, ranging from simple one-at-a-time methods to statistical evaluations of the 
output distribution \citep[e.g. variance-based or density-based approaches][]{pianosi_sensitivity_2016}. Especially the latter indices are easy to interpret and can be compared across different parameters and/or different model outputs as 
they generally take values between zero and one ($S_i \in [0, 1]$). An index of zero indicates a non-influential parameter and a higher value a more influential parameter. 
Here, we use SA mainly to identify which parameters have the largest impact on the different model outputs and therefore require careful calibration. 
% and if there is any factor whose variability has a negligible effects on specific outputs?
%Due to OMEN-SED's computational efficiency we are able to apply one of the approaches requiring higher numbers of model evaluations to compute the sensitivity index.  
As the probability density functions of our model outputs (i.e. the resulting SWI-fluxes) are generally highly-skewed towards extreme organic matter degradation rates (not shown) variance-based sensitivity indices are not very 
reliable uncertainty indicators \citep{pianosi_sensitivity_2016}. Rather than just considering the variance we employ the novel density-based PAWN method by \citet{pianosi_simple_2015} which considers the entire conditional and unconditional 
Cumulative Destribution Function (CDF) of the model output. % Probability Density Function (PDF) 
The sensitivity index of parameter $i$ is calculated as the difference between the two CDFs, i.e.
\begin{equation}
 S_i = \max_{x_i} \max_{y} | F_y(y) - F_{y|x_i}(y) |
\end{equation}
where $F_y(y)$ is the unconditional CDF of the output $y$ and $F_{y|x_i}(y)$ represents the conditional CDF when the $i$-th parameter is fixed to $x_i$. 
For a more detailed description of the method we refer the interested reader to \citet{pianosi_simple_2015}. 

Due to the model complexity it is impossible to compute the sensitivity indices analytically therefore they are approximated from a Latin-Hypercube sampling of parameter inputs and calculated outputs.
The PAWN method, as implemented within the Sensitivity Analysis for Everyone (SAFE) matlab toolbox \citep{pianosi_matlab_2015}, is used to investigate 11 model parameters for ranges as specified in Table \ref{table:SA_parameter_ranges}. 
Sensitivity indices for all resulting SWI-fluxes for two idealised sediment conditions (i.e. anoxic at 400\,m and oxic at 4000\,m, see Table \ref{table:SA_2Cases}) are calculated. 
We use 200 samples to estimate the unconditional CDF, 100 samples to estimate the conditional CDFs and 10 conditioning points, thus 11,200 evaluations are performed for each sediment condition. 
The resulting indices (compare Fig. \ref{fig:SA_O2+NO3} in the Appendix) 
are then translated into a color code and summarised in a pattern plot to simplify comparison (Fig. \ref{fig:Sensitivity_Analysis}). 
The most significant parameters for all model outputs are the degradation rate for the labile OM part ($\chem{k_1}$) and its share in the total OM pool ($\chem{f_1}$).
For the anoxic setup, where no oxidation occurs, the secondary redox parameters (i.e. $\gamma_\chem{NH_4},\ \gamma_\chem{H_2S}$) are essentially non-influential. 
Whereas in the oxic scenario, SWI-fluxes of \chem{NH_4}, \chem{SO_4} and \chem{H_2S} are very sensitive to changes in the secondary redox parameters. % with sensitivities of ....., respectively.
The $\chem{PO_4}$ SWI-flux appears to be insensitive especially under for the oxic condition as the majority is absorbed to $\chem{Fe}$-oxides. The sensitivities change 
if other $\chem{PO_4}$ related equilibrium concentrations $\chem{PO_4}^s$, $\chem{PO_4}^a$ and $\chem{M}^\infty$ are used (not shown).

To test if OMEN-SED is able to reproduce the magnitude of observed SWI-fluxes, another set of Latin-Hypercube samplings is produced for the two idealised sediment conditions (sample sizes $N=3500$) . 
Here the two most sensitive parameters $\chem{k_1}$ and $\chem{f_1}$ and also $\widetilde{\chem{k_2}}$ are varied, the other parameters are set to their default values (Tables \ref{table:sed-charac_transport-parameters} and \ref{table:reaction_parameters}). 
For the deep sea condition we account for the presence of more refractory OM by sampling $\chem{f_1} \in [0.02, 0.3]$. Minimum and Maximum values for the other parameters are as in Table \ref{table:SA_parameter_ranges}.
The results are compared with a global database of benthic fluxes of $\chem{O_2}$ and $\chem{NO_3}$ \citep{bohlen_simple_2012}. 
The coloured scatter plots in Figure \ref{fig:SA_Color_ScatterPlots} show that the observed fluxes fall well in the range of SWI-fluxes calculated with OMEN-SED. 
Also highlighted by the emergence of colour patterns in Figure \ref{fig:SA_Color_ScatterPlots} A+B are the strong interactions between the amount of labile OM  $\chem{f_1}$ and 
its degradation rate $\chem{k_1}$ for the resulting SWI-fluxes of the most powerful TEA available. In general, a higher degradation rate in combination with more labile OM available 
leads to a higher SWI-flux.

\subsection{Pre-industrial cGENIE coupling and the OM degradation rate}\label{subsec:GENIE-pre-ind}
OMEN-SED has been coupled to the global Earth system model cGENIE as described in Section \ref{subsubsec:ESM_coupling}. 
Our objective is not to perform and discuss a detailed calibration of the two  models, as this is beyond the scope of this model development paper. 
We rather want to showcase, that a coupling is possible and the results show  main sediment features one would expect to see on a global scale. 
All simulations are run for 20,000 years to steady-state. OMEN-SED is called for each grid-cell in every time step, feeding back the resulting SWI-fluxes and the 
fraction of POC preserved in the sediments to cGENIE. 

As shown in our sensitivity analysis (Figure \ref{fig:Sensitivity_Analysis}) and discussed by \citet{arndt_quantifying_2013} the 
degradation rate constants for OM ($k_i$) are the most influential parameters and strongly determine the SWI-flux of redox-sensitive elements. 
Yet, their spatial variability is unknown at the global scale and reported rate constants can vary by almost 10 orders of magnitude \citep{arndt_quantifying_2013}, 
thus defining appropriate OM degradation rate constants is a major challenge and source of uncertainty for diagenetic models. The rate constants in models are either determined through profile fitting for a specific site or, 
for global applications, they are related to a single, readily available characteristic (or master variable) of the local environmental conditions. 
For instance, considerable effort has been expended to relate the apparent rate constant for oxic and 
anoxic OM degradation to sedimentation rate ($w$) and various empirical relations have been proposed \citep{toth_organic_1977, tromp_global_1995, boudreau1997diagenetic, stolpovsky_toward_2015}. 
Nevertheless, these relationships are generally based on limited data sets and their global applicability is questionable \citep{arndt_quantifying_2013}. 
We test globally invariant values for the OM degradation rate constants as well as different published parameterisations (see Table \ref{table:OM_degrad_para}) to test 
whether the different approaches are able to recreate main sediment characteristics. %importance of this parameter for our model results. 
Depending on oxygen concentration in the bottom water, $k_1$ is defined as the oxic or anoxic degradation rate (anoxic for $[\chem{O_2}] < 5$ nanomole cm$^{-3}$ ). 
The more refractory component is assumed to degrade one hundred times slower \citep[$k_2 = k_1/100$, see e.g.][]{boudreau1997diagenetic}. 

\begin{table}[btp]
\caption{List of  coupled OMEN-cGENIE experiments with oxic and anoxic rate constants ($k_1$, yr$^{-1}$). The rate constant $k_2$ for the more refractory component is

Schulz and Zabel: 
The basic mechanism inducing microbial activity
is the supply of organic matter to the seafloor and
this is generally coupled to surface water produc-
tivity. Most of the highly productive areas in the
global ocean are adjacent to the continents, so 
that we can expect a decrease of degradation inten-
sity from the coastal marine environments over
the continental shelves and slopes into the deep-
sea. This becomes evident when we look at the
data compiled by Middelburg et al. (1993) which
indicate that 83\% mineralization and 87\% burial in
marine sediments occurs in the coastal zone
occupying only ~9\% of the total ocean area. This
means that the sediments with the highest respi-
ration rates also have the highest burial efficiency
in marine environments.
Fluxes of oxygen and nitrate, therefore, vary
over several orders of magnitude between oligo-
trophic open ocean areas and continental shelf and
slope areas. This is about 50 to 6,000 mmol m -2 yr -1
for oxygen and -600 to 380 mmol m -2 yr -1 for nitrate ...

(SHOW O2, NO3 AND E.G. PO4 SWI-fluxes).

Also check what water column features to show and maybe sediment P or Fe-P concentrations (see PALASTANGA et al. 2011, 2013).

Stolpovsky: bioturbated sediments deposited at continental margins quickly become anoxic within a few millimeters [Wenzhöfer and Glud, 2002].

% Fe-P supply problem (see Palastanga et al. 2011): ... the sinking flux of atmospheric P is ultimately deposited
% into the sediment. Up-to-date, there is very little data on the speciation of atmospheric P ... we assume an constant aeolian supply of P as Fe-P to the sediments of ....

% From Boudreau book on POC fractions and their degradation constants:
% Furthermore, it has been realized that there is not a single
% organic matter type in sediments, but many. The data suggest that there is a reactive
% fraction, k1, that decays within the top 10-20 cm of sediments, a more refractory
% component, k2, that oxidizes on a scale of about ten to one hundred times longer, and a
% third that is largely inert. The k2 material is largely, if not completely, subject to
% anoxic decomposition. There is also a highly reactive component, say ko, that
% decomposes on a seasonal time scale, largely at the sediment-water interface and in the
% top centimeter of sediments, i.e. ko = 1-10 yr-1. Predictive correlations have, so far,
% been applied only to k1 and k2.

% From Stolpovsky: 
% Our objective was to find an empirical function relating the depth distribution of POC mineralization to rain
% rate (RRPOC). This is an attractive master variable because (i) POC fluxes to the seafloor are reasonably well
% known and routinely computed by ESMs [e.g., Dunne et al., 2007] and (ii) POC reactivity appears to be
% correlated with rain rate [Emerson et al., 1985; Murray and Kuivila, 1990; Soetaert et al., 1996; Boudreau, 1997;
% Martin and Sayles, 2006].

% Middelburg: Ocean margin sediments (<2000 m) account for about 85% of the material
% accumulating in the ocean and about 80-90\% of the mineralization in marine sediments.

\section{Scope of applicability and model limitations}
State-of-the art numerical models representing the full complexity of the diagenetic processes typically perform adequately at reproducing site-specific biogeochemical dynamics, however, tuning model parameters is laborious, 
the computational demand is high and, thus, their transferability to the global scale is limited. On the other hand, analytical models are very efficient, but existing approaches coupled to global models generally use highly 
simplified reaction networks, often restricted to oxic degradation with a limited number of explicit pore water tracers. However, our ability to assess the role of organic matter dynamics for global biogeochemical cycles and climate 
requires tools that resolve the most important biogeochemical processes and tracers explicitly, while at the same time are computationally efficient and have a degree of predictive capability to extrapolate knowledge to data poor areas. 
The new model OMEN-SED presented here is a legitimate compromise between complexity of biogeochemical processes and computational efficiency. 
Its scope of applicability covers the entire range from regional to global scales. 
OMEN-SED's computational efficiency facilitates its use in two very different ways. Firstly, it can be coupled to global Earth system models and therefore allows the investigation of coupled global biogeochemical dynamics over different timescales. 
Secondly, it can be used to calculate quantitative sensitivity indices requiring large sample sizes such as variance- or density-based approaches. Therefore, OMEN-SED can help to quantitatively investigate how systematic variations in model parameters 
impact the model output, for instance when the model has been tuned to a site-specific problem. 
Due to the represented anaerobic processes and secondary-redox reactions, OMEN-SED is also useful to investigate the role of benthic-pelagic coupling on the development of ocean anoxia and euxinia for instance during extreme climate 
events such as OAEs. On more regional scales it can be applied to systems like continental margins or estuaries which are characterised by complex interactions between different pathways of organic matter degradation and redox reactions. 
Here, the model can help to disentangle the complex process interplay that drives the biogeochemical dynamics and give quantifications for upper and lower constraints of carbon and nutrient budgets for these dynamic systems. 
In addition, OMEN-SED can be used to model eutrophication processes in shallow coastal waters as sediment-water oxygen and nutrient exchange fluxes are explicitly modelled and depend on re-oxidation of reduced substances which causes a substantial 
part of oxygen consumption in these environments. %diagenetic OM degradation, bottom water concentrations, temperature.  

However, the model presented here, even more complete than previous analytical models, is still associated with a certain degree of simplifications. In order to solve the diagenetic equation analytically important assumptions have been made, which limit 
the general applicability of the model. One of the most important simplifications is assuming steady-state. 
When coupled to an Earth system model this assumption is only valid if the relevant variability in boundary conditions and fluxes is generally longer than the characteristic timescales of the reaction-transport processes. 
In that case the sediment column can be described by a series of pseudo steady-states as it is done in OMEN-SED. Consequently, the model can be used for investigating the long term effects of changes in boundary conditions such as the the input of OM 
or bottom water oxidation state on degradation and burial dynamics, as for instance during OAEs. Yet, it is not able to predict the system response to short-term or seasonal variations of boundary conditions. 
The separation of the sediment column into distinct biogeochemical zones and the resulting lack of overlap in respiration pathways may cause distorted organic matter respiration rates for the different TEAs. 
For instance, in OMEN-SED denitrification does not occur in the oxic layer, while in reality, although inhibited by the presence of oxygen, denitrification can still occur in the oxic zone, even at shallow sediments depths with high OM contents. 
Manganese and iron are not represented and as such OMEN-SED is not able to model all processes important in coastal marine environments and highly accumulating upwelling regions. This can cause problems when modelling \chem{H_2S} and \chem{PO_4} 
profiles in anoxic environments as their concentrations are affected by these metal ions (compare Section \ref{subsec:SedProfiles}). 
In addition the depth invariant porosity limits the correct calculation of the sediment-water interface flux of dissolved species as in reality porosity decreases with sediment depth. 


% \textbf{reoxidation of a fixed fraction of NH4 and H2S and just a first order rate constant for OM degradation:}\\
% instead of using a kinetic approach 


% \textbf{degradation rate constant:}\\
% Furthermore, the spatial variability in benthic OM degradation kinetics is unknown at the global scale and reported rate constants can vary by almost 10 orders of magnitude \citep{arndt_quantifying_2013}.
% Thus, a major challenge for diagenetic models is defining appropriate OM degradation rate constants which is either achieved 
% through profile fitting for a specific site or, for global applications, the rate constants follow empirical relations with a related, readily available sediment characteristic such as water depth 
% \citep{middelburg_empirical_1997}, sedimentation rate \citep{toth_organic_1977, tromp_global_1995} or OM flux \citep{boudreau1997diagenetic}. 
% However, these relationships are mostly based on simple fitting exercises to limited data sets and show at the most a very weak trend and no statistically significant relationship \citep{arndt_quantifying_2013}. 
% This creates considerable uncertainties when diagenetic models are coupled to global biogeochemical ocean models especially when applying the model for different geological timescales. % see: https://goldschmidtabstracts.info/2013/2270.pdf
% Other model parameters implicitly accounting for processes not explicitly described are sedimentation and bioturbation rate and are generally related to water depth following \citet{middelburg_empirical_1997}.



\conclusions  %% \conclusions[modified heading if necessary]
In this paper we have described and tested a new, analytical early diagenetic model resolving organic matter cycling and associated biogeochemical dynamics called OMEN-SED. 
Our new model is the first of this class of analytical approaches to explicitly represent oxic degradation, denitrification, sulfate reduction and implicitly methanogenesis, 
as well as the re-oxidation of reduced substances produced during organic matter degradation. Pore water tracers include \chem{O_2}, \chem{NO_3}, \chem{NH_4}, \chem{SO_4}, \chem{H_2S}, \chem{DIC} and \chem{ALK} and the solid phase includes 
two fractions of organic matter, Fe-bound P and authigenic Ca-P minerals. 
We have shown that the new analytical model is able to reproduce observed pore water profiles from different ocean depths when organic matter partitioning and degradation rate constants are tuned to site specific conditions. An extensive sensitive analysis, 
based on the novel density-based PAWN method \citep{pianosi_simple_2015}, has been performed to asses the importance of 11 internal model parameters for all resulting SWI-fluxes. The results reveal that the degradation rate constant for labile organic 
matter is the most influential parameter for all model outputs. Under anoxic conditions secondary redox parameters exert an important control on related SWI-fluxes of \chem{SO_4}, \chem{H_2S}, \chem{NH_4} and alkalinity. 
In addition, the sensitivity analysis showed that globally observed benthic \chem{O_2} and \chem{NO_3} fluxes fall well into the range of produced model results. 

Furthermore, the coupling of OMEN-SED to the Earth system model cGENIE is described and various published parameterisations for the apparent first order degradation rate constant are tested to fit the model to observed global organic matter concentrations. 
\textcolor{red}{TODO: write about results.}
...in order to investigate the role of sediments for global biogeochemical cycles and cimate.
