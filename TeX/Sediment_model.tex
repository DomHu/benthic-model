\section{Model Description}
This section describes the formulation and solution of the model (see Table \ref{table:reactions_processes} for the implemented processes). 
A glossary of parameters along with their respective units is provided in Tables \ref{table:sed-charac_transport-parameters} and \ref{table:reaction_parameters}.

\subsection {General Model Approach} \label{subsec:GeneralModelApproach}
The calculation of benthic return/uptake and burial fluxes is based on the vertically resolved conservation equation for solid and dissolved species in porous media is given by 
\citep[e.g.][]{berner_early_1980, boudreau1997diagenetic}:

\begin{equation} 
\frac{\partial \xi C_i}{\partial t}=-\frac{\partial F}{\partial z}+\xi \sum_j R_i^j \label{eq:Eq_generaldiagenetic}
\end{equation}

where $C_i$ is the concentration of the biogeochemical species $i$, $\xi$ equals the porosity $\phi$ for solute species and $(1-\phi)$ for solid species, hence represents the partitioning of species $i$ 
into the solute and dissolved phase. The term $z$ is the sediment depth, $t$ denotes the time, $F$ summarises the transport fluxes and $\sum_j R_i^j$ represents the sum of production/consumption rates $j$ 
that affect species $i$. The reaction network has to account for the most important primary and secondary redox reactions, equilibrium reactions, mineral dissolution and precipitation, as well as adsorption 
and desorption processes.\\
State-of-the-art reaction-transport models generally solve the ordinary differential equation (ODE) (\ref{eq:Eq_generaldiagenetic}) numerically and thus allow to account for transient conditions, depth-varying parameters or a high degree of coupling 
between different chemical species. Yet, numerical models are computational expensive, thus rendering their application in an Earth System Model framework prohibitive. 
An analytical solution of Eq. (\ref{eq:Eq_generaldiagenetic}) provides an alternative and computational more efficient approach. Analytical models enjoyed great popularity in the early days of diagenetic modelling 
due to the low computing power. However, early analytical models were often very problem-specific and only considered one or two coupled species  \textcolor{red}{(e.g. Lehrman, Berner) ?? which pubs?}. 
A number of more complex analytical models describing the coupled dynamics of ....were developed \citep[e.g.][]{billen1982modelling, goloway1982diagenetic, jahnke1982model}.

	\end{center}
\end{figure}

Finding an analytical solution to  Eq. (\ref{eq:Eq_generaldiagenetic}), especially when complex reaction networks are to be considered is not straightforward and generally requires the assumption of steady state. 
Because the Earth system model relevant variability in boundary conditions and fluxes is generally longer than the characteristic timescales of the reaction-transport processes, the sediment can be described by a 
series of pseudo steady-states. In addition, the complexity of the reaction network can be reduced by dividing the sediment into distinct zones and accounting for the most pertinent biogeochemical processes 
within each zone, thus increasing the likelihood of finding an analytical solution to Eq. (\ref{eq:Eq_generaldiagenetic}). The model divides the sediment into a bioturbated and a non-bioturbated zone 
defined by the constant bioturbation depth $z_{\mathrm{bio}}$. In addition, it accounts for the dynamic redox zonation of marine sediments by dividing the sediment into: 2) an oxic zone situated between the 
SWI and a dynamically calculated penetration depth of oxygen $z_{\mathrm{ox}}$, 3) a denitrification zone situated between $z_{\mathrm{ox}}$ and a dynamically calculated penetration depth of nitrate $z_{\chem{NO_3}}$, 4) 
a sulfate reduction zone situated between $z_{\chem{NO_3}}$ and a dynamically calculated penetration depth of sulfate $z_{\chem{SO_4}}$ and 5) a methanic zone situated below $z_{\chem{SO_4}}$ (Figure \ref{fig:Sediment_layers}). 
Each zone is characterised by a set of diagenetic equations that encapsulate the most pertinent reaction and transport processes in the respective zone (see section \ref{subsec:Transport} and \ref{subsec:ReactionNetwork} 
for more details). 


\subsection{Transport}\label{subsec:Transport}
The model accounts for both advection and diffusion of dissolved and solid species, assuming that sediment compaction is negligible ($\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z}$=0). 
The diffusion of dissolved species is described via an apparent diffusion coefficient, $D_{i0}$. In addition, the activity of infaunal organisms in the bioturbated zone of the sediment ($z<z_{\mathrm{bio}}$) causes random 
displacements of sediments and porewaters and is simulated using a diffusive term (e.g. Boudreau,1986), with a constant bioturbation coefficient $D_{\mathrm{bio}}$ in the bioturbated zone. 
The pumping activity by burrow-dwelling animals and the resulting ventilation of tubes, the so-called bioirrigation, is encapsulated in a factor, $f_{ir}$ that enhances the molecular diffusion coefficient, 
$D_{\mathrm{mol},i}$ \citep[ hence, $D_{i,0}=D_{\mathrm{mol},i}\cdot f_{ir}$,][]{soetaert1996dynamic}.  The divergence of the flux is thus given by:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial F}{\partial z}=-\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\left( -\xi D_i \frac{\partial C_i}{\partial z} +\xi w C_i\right) \label{Eq_flux_divergence}
\end{equation}
where $D_i$ is the diffusion coefficient of species $i$ ($D_i=D_{i,0}+D_{\mathrm{bio}}=D_{\mathrm{mol},i}\cdot f_{ir}+D_{\mathrm{bio}}$ for dissolved species and $D_i=D_{\mathrm{bio}}$ for solid species) and $w$ is the burial rate. 
The bioturbation coefficient $D_{\mathrm{bio}}$ is set to zero below $z_{\mathrm{bio}}$. In addition, infaunnal activity ceases ($D_{\mathrm{bio}}=0$) once bottom waters become anoxic (\chem{O_2} = 0.0 mol cm$^{-3}$ ).

\subsection{Reaction Network}\label{subsec:ReactionNetwork}
Earth System models generally track the evolution of the global biogeochemical cycles of organic and inorganic carbon, the essential nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus) and oxygen with the aim of investigating the evolution 
of the ocean's redox structure and carbonate system and its feedbacks on global climate. This general aim thus defines a minimum set of state variables and reaction processes that need to be resolved for an efficient 
representation of the benthic-pelagic coupling in Earth System Models. The sediment model has to provide robust quantifications of organic and inorganic carbon burial fluxes, growth-limiting nutrient, equilibrium invariant 
and reduced species return fluxes, and oxygen uptake fluxes. As a consequence, the reaction network must explicitly or implicitly account for the most important primary and secondary redox reactions, equilibrium reactions, 
mineral precipitation/dissolution and adsorption/desorption, resulting in a complex set of coupled reaction-transport equations. The following 
subsections provide a short discussion of the reaction processes included in the model and give an overview of the 
vertically resolved conservation equations and boundary conditions for solid and dissolved species in each layer. Table \ref{table:reactions_processes} states the reactions and variables considered in the reaction network.

\subsubsection{Organic matter}
In marine sediments, organic matter (OM) is degraded by heterotrophic activity coupled to the sequential utilisation of terminal electron acceptors (TEAs), typically in the order of \chem{O_2}, \chem{NO_3^-}, Mn(VI), Fe(III) and 
\chem{SO_4^{2-}} followed by methanogenesis and/or fermentation. Organic matter degradation is described via a multi-G model approach \citep[][and references therein]{arndt_quantifying_2013}, assuming that the bulk OM is divided 
into discrete compound classes $C_i$ characterised by specific degradation rate constants $k_i$. Such a multi-G approach allows for selective preservation of compound classes according to their degradability, $k_i$ and, thus, 
accounts for the change in organic matter degradability with burial. Each compound class is degraded according to first-order kinetics. Organic matter dynamics are thus described by:

\begin{equation}
 \frac{\partial C_i}{\partial t} = 0= D_{C_i} \frac{\partial^2C_i }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial C_i }{\partial z} - k_i\cdot C_{i} \label{eq:ODE_OC}
\end{equation}
% where:
% \begin{align}
%  D_{C_i}&=D_{\mathrm{bio}} 	 &\text{if ($z\leq z_{\mathrm{bio}}$)}\\
%  D_{C_i}&=0            &\text{if ($z > z_{\mathrm{bio}}$)} 
% \end{align}
The solution of Eq. \ref{eq:ODE_OC} (see section \ref{sec:Solution} for details) requires the definition of boundary conditions. The model assumes a known concentration/flux at the sediment-water interface and continuity 
across the bottom of the bioturbated zone, $z_{\mathrm{bio}}$ (Table \ref{Tab:BC_OM+O2}).

\subsubsection{Oxygen}
Oxygen serves as the most powerful terminal electron acceptor for the heterotrophic degradation of organic carbon. In addition, the oxidation of reduced species produced through microbial activity throughout the 
sediment column further contributes to the consumption of oxygen. The model explicitly accounts for the consumption of oxygen by heterotrophic degradation and nitrification of ammonium in the oxic layer of the sediment. 
The nitrification of 1 mol of ammonium in the oxic layer consumes 2 mol of oxygen. 
In addition, the oxygen consumption through the oxidation of reduced species (\chem{Fe^{2+}}, \chem{Mn^{2+}}, \chem{NH_4}, \chem{H_2S}) produced in the suboxic and anoxic layers of the sediment is implicitly taken into account 
through the flux boundary condition at the dynamic oxygen penetration depth $z_{\mathrm{ox}}$. This simplification can be justified as it has been shown that these secondary redox reactions mainly occur at the oxic/suboxic 
interface \citep{soetaert_model_1996}.  
Oxygen is described in mol\,cm$^{-3}$ liquid and conversion from the solid phase of mineralized organic matter (expressed in mol\,cm$^{-3}$ bulk sediment) to consumption of dissolved oxygen (or later nutrients) introduce 
a factor of $\frac{1-\phi}{\phi}$, where $\phi$ is the sediment porosity. Oxygen dynamics are thus described by:
\begin{align} 
 \frac{\partial \chem{O_2}}{\partial t} &= 0= D_{\chem{ \chem{O_2}}}\frac{\partial^2  \chem{O_2} }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial  \chem{O_2}}{\partial z} - \frac{1-\phi}{\phi}\sum_i k_i \cdot [ OC + 2 \gamma_{\chem{NH_4}} \chem{NC_i} ]\cdot C_{i}(z) \label{eq:ODE_O2_1}
\end{align}
% where:
% \begin{align}
%  D_{ \chem{O_2}}&=D_{ \chem{O_2}, 0}+D_{\mathrm{bio}}  &\text{if ($z\leq z_{\mathrm{bio}}$)}\\
%  D_{ \chem{O_2}}&=D_{ \chem{O_2}, 0}                &\text{if ($z > z_{\mathrm{bio}}$)} 
% \end{align}  
To solve Eq. \ref{eq:ODE_O2_1} analytically (see section \ref{sec:Solution}) boundary conditions at three depths are defined (Table \ref{Tab:BC_OM+O2}). 
The model assumes a known bottom water concentration and the complete consumption of oxygen at the oxygen penetration depth (or zero flux if $z_{\mathrm{ox}}=z_\infty$). 
It considers equal oxygen concentration and diffusive flux above ($z_{\mathrm{bio}}^-$) and 
below ($z_{\mathrm{bio}}^+$) the bioturbation boundary. In addition, the model imposes a flux of reduced species through the bottom of the oxic zone that is calculated as the reduced substances produced through anoxic mineralization 
of organic matter below $z_{\mathrm{ox}}$. Thus, assuming that fractions ($\gamma_{\chem{NH_4}}$ and $\delta$) of these reduced species are oxidised at the oxic/suboxic interface.

%assumes a complete oxidation of these species at the oxic/suboxic interface:   
\subsubsection{Nitrate and Ammonium}
%Nitrate and ammonium are described in $mol\ cm^{-3}$ liquid and a factor of $\frac{1-\phi}{\phi}$ is introduced to account for the conversion from mineralization rates to production of dissolved species. 
%To model nutrient dynamics the sediment is partitioned into two geochemical layers (oxic and suboxic)
To model nitrate and ammonium dynamics the sediment is partitioned into two geochemical layers (oxic and suboxic), where different equations describe the biogeochemical processes. 
Above the oxygen penetration depth organic matter mineralization produces ammonium, which is partly nitrified to nitrate (the fraction $\gamma_{\chem{NH_4}}$). 
In the suboxic zone ($z>z_{\mathrm{ox}}$), oxygen concentration is zero and nitrate serves as the electron acceptor to respire organic matter, thus nitrate is consumed by denitrification and ammonium is produced. Below the nitrate 
penetration depth $z_{\chem{NO_3}}$, ammonium is still produced through OM mineralization. Therefore the diagenetic equations for nitrate and ammonium are given by:
\begin{align}
\intertext{1. Layer ($z \leq z_{\mathrm{ox}}$)}
 \frac{\partial NO_3^I}{\partial t} &= 0 = D_{NO_3} \frac{\partial^2NO_3^I }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial NO_3^I }{\partial z} + \gamma_{\chem{NH_4}} \frac{1-\phi}{\phi} \cdot \sum_i \chem{NC_i} \cdot k_i \cdot C_{i}(z)\label{eq:NO3_ODE1_L1}\\ %\qquad &\text{1. Layer ($z\leq z_{\mathrm{ox}}$)}\\

 \intertext{2. Layer ($z_{\mathrm{ox}} < z \leq z_{\chem{NO_3}}$ [or $z_\infty$ for \chem{NH_4}])} 
\frac{\partial NO_3^{II}}{\partial t} &= 0 = D_{NO_3} \frac{\partial^2NO_3^{II} }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial NO_3^{II} }{\partial z} - \frac{1-\phi}{\phi} NO_3C \cdot \sum_i k_i \cdot C_{i}(z) \label{eq:NO3_ODE1_L2}\\
\frac{\partial \chem{NH_4}^{II}}{\partial t} &= 0 = D_{\chem{NH_4}} \frac{\partial^2\chem{NH_4}^{II} }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{NH_4}^{II} }{\partial z} + \frac{1-\phi}{\phi} \cdot \sum_i \chem{NC_i} \cdot k_i \cdot C_{i}(z)\label{eq:NH4_ODE1_L2}
\end{align}

%  D_{i}&=D_{i, 0}+D_{\mathrm{bio}} &\text{if ($z\leq z_{\mathrm{bio}}$)}\\

The boundary conditions to solve Equations \ref{eq:NO3_ODE1_L1} - \ref{eq:NH4_ODE1_L2} are summarized in Table \ref{Tab:BC_NO3+NH4}. The model assumes known bottom water concentrations 
for both species, the complete consumption of nitrate at the nitrate penetration depth (or zero flux if $z_{\chem{NO_3}}=z_\infty$) and no change in ammonium flux at $z_\infty$. It considers equal concentrations and diffusive fluxes 
at $z_{\mathrm{bio}}$ and $z_{\mathrm{ox}}$.  In addition, the re-oxidation of upward-diffusing reduced ammonium is considered in the oxic-suboxic boundary condition for nitrate and ammonium.

When nitrate is depleted, sulfate reduction is the pathway to mineralize organic matter, thus consuming sulfate (SO$_4$) and producing hydrogen sulfide (H$_2$S) until the sulfate penetration depth ($z_{\chem{\chem{SO_4}}}$). 
Sulfate and sulfide dynamics are thus described by:
\begin{align}
\intertext{1. Layer ($z \leq z_{\chem{NO_3}}$)}
 \frac{\partial \chem{SO_4}^I}{\partial t} &= 0 = D_{\chem{SO_4}} \frac{\partial^2\chem{SO_4}^I }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{SO_4}^I }{\partial z} \label{eq:SO4_ODE1_L1}\\ %\qquad &\text{1. Layer ($z\leq z_{\mathrm{ox}}$)}\\
 \frac{\partial \chem{H_2S}^I}{\partial t} &= 0 = D_{\chem{H_2S}} \frac{\partial^2\chem{H_2S}^I }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{H_2S}^I }{\partial z}\label{eq:H2S_ODE1_L1}\\
 \intertext{2. Layer ($z_{\chem{NO_3}} < z \leq z_{\chem{SO_4}}$)} 
\frac{\partial \chem{SO_4}^{II}}{\partial t} &= 0 = D_{\chem{SO_4}} \frac{\partial^2\chem{SO_4}^{II} }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{SO_4}^{II} }{\partial z} - \frac{1-\phi}{\phi} \cdot \sum_i \chem{SO_4C} \cdot k_i \cdot C_{i}(z) \label{eq:NO3_ODE1_L2}\\
\frac{\partial \chem{H_2S}^{II}}{\partial t} &= 0 = D_{\chem{H_2S}} \frac{\partial^2\chem{H_2S}^{II} }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{H_2S}^{II} }{\partial z} + \frac{1-\phi}{\phi} \cdot \sum_i \chem{SO_4C}  \cdot k_i \cdot C_{i}(z)\label{eq:NH4_ODE1_L2}
\end{align}
% where
% \begin{align}
%  D_{i}&=D_{i, 0}+D_{\mathrm{bio}} &\text{if ($z\leq z_{\mathrm{bio}}$)}\\
%  D_{i}&=D_{i, 0}                &\text{if ($z > z_{\mathrm{bio}}$)} 
% \end{align} 
% and $i \in \{$SO$_4$, H$_2$S$\}$. 
To solve equations \ref{eq:SO4_ODE1_L1} - \ref{eq:NH4_ODE1_L2} the model assumes known concentrations at the sediment-water interface and continuity 
across the bioturbation depth ($z_{\mathrm{bio}}$) and the nitrate penetration depth ($z_{\chem{NO_3}}$) (see Table \ref{Tab:BC_SO4+H2S}). The re-oxidation of reduced H$_2$S from below is considered in the oxic-suboxic boundary condition 
for both species. At the sulfate penetration depth ($z_{\chem{SO_4}}$) sulfate is used for anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) which is produced below $z_{\chem{SO_4}}$. Therefore sulfate concentration is zero and its diffusive flux must equal 
the amount of methane produced below. Additionally H$_2$S is produced by AOM which is considered in the flux boundary condition at $z_{\chem{SO_4}}$ . \textcolor{red}{correct??}\\

\end{figure}
To model phosphorus (P) in the sediments the model takes into account the change with depth of phosphate (PO$_4$) and iron-bound P, thereby mainly following the description of \citet{caroline_p_slomp_key_1996} 
and \citet{gypens_simple_2008}. Throughout the sediment column organic matter is mineralized resulting in a release of phosphate to the pore water. In the oxic part of the sediment, this PO$_4$ either 
diffuses upward to the water column or is adsorped to Fe oxides forming Fe-bound P (or M)\citep{slomp1998role}. In the suboxic/anoxic zone, PO$_4$ is not only produced through organic matter degradation but is 
also released from the Fe-bound P pool due to the reduction of Fe oxides. Furthermore, phosphate concentrations can become high enough in this layer for authigenic mineral formation to occur \citep{cappellen_mathematical_1988}. 
This phosphorus bound in authigenic minerals represents a permanent sink for reactive phosphorus \citep{caroline_p_slomp_key_1996}. See Figure \ref{fig:P-cycle} for a schematic overview of the sedimentary P cycle.
Therefore the diagenetic equations for phosphorus are written:
\begin{align}
\intertext{1. Layer ($z \leq z_{\mathrm{ox}}$)}
 \frac{\partial \chem{PO_4}^I}{\partial t} &= \frac{D_{\chem{PO_4}}}{1+K_{\chem{PO_4}}^I} \frac{\partial^2\chem{PO_4}^I }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{PO_4}^I }{\partial z} + \frac{1-\phi}{\phi \cdot (1+K_{\chem{PO_4}}^I)}\sum_i 
					\left( \chem{PC}_i \cdot k_i \cdot C_{i}(z) \right) \notag\\

 \frac{\partial M^I}{\partial t} &= D_{M}\frac{\partial^2M^I }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial M^I }{\partial z} + k_{s}\frac{\phi}{1-\phi}(\chem{PO_4}^I-\chem{PO_4}^s)\label{eq:M_ODE_L1}\\  
 \intertext{2. Layer ($z_{\mathrm{ox}} < z$)} 
 \frac{\partial M^{II}}{\partial t} & = D_{M}\frac{\partial^2M^{II} }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial M^{II} }{\partial z} - k_{m}(M^{II} - M^\infty)\label{eq:M_ODE_L2}\\  
 \frac{\partial \chem{PO_4}^{II}}{\partial t} &= \frac{D_{\chem{PO_4}}^1}{1+K_{\chem{PO_4}}^{II}} \frac{\partial^2\chem{PO_4}^{II} }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{PO_4}^{II} }{\partial z} + \frac{1-\phi}{\phi \cdot (1+K_{\chem{PO_4}}^{II})}\sum_i 
					\left( \chem{PC}_i \cdot k_i \cdot C_{i}(z) \right) \notag\\
					& - \frac{k_{a}}{1+K_{\chem{PO_4}}^{II}}(\chem{PO_4}^{II}-\chem{PO_4}^a) + \frac{(1-\phi)k_{m}}{\phi(1+K_{\chem{PO_4}}^{II})}(M^{II}-M^\infty)\label{eq:PO4_ODE_L2}\\
\end{align}
% where
% \begin{align}
%  D_{\chem{PO_4}}&=D_{\chem{PO_4}, 0}+D_{\mathrm{bio}} &\text{ and }\quad D_{M}&= D_{\mathrm{bio}} &\text{if ($z\leq z_{\mathrm{bio}}$)}\\

The boundary conditions to solve Equations \ref{eq:PO4_ODE_L1} - \ref{eq:PO4_ODE_L2} are summarized in Table \ref{Tab:BC_PO4+M}. 
The model assumes known bottom water concentrations and equal concentrations and diffusive fluxes at $z_{\mathrm{bio}}$ and $z_{\mathrm{ox}}$ for both species. Additionally it considers no change in phosphate flux and an assymptotic Fe-bound P 
concentration at $z_\infty$.

\subsection{Model Parameters}
This section describes the parameters used in SED (1.0) to describe sediment transport and biogeochemical reactions related to the burial and mineralization of organic matter under a wide range of environmental conditions. 
Table \ref{table:sed-charac_transport-parameters} states the parameters for sediment characteristics and Table \ref{table:reaction_parameters} summarizes the stoichiometric factors and 
secondary reaction parameters used in the model.

\subsubsection{Transport Parameters}
Advection is the bulk flow of sediments and can be directly related to the accumulation of new material on the seafloor \citep[i.e. sedimentation,][]{burdige2006geochemistry}. 
This results in a downward flux of older sediment material and porewater in relation to the sediment-water interface. SED (1.0) uses the empirical global relationship between 
sediment accumulation rate (cm yr$^{-1}$) and seafloor depth (m) of \citet{middelburg_empirical_1997}: 
\begin{equation}
 w = 3.3\cdot 10^{-0.87478367-0.00043512\cdot \text{depth}}\label{eq:sedimentation_rate}
\end{equation}
As discussed before (Sec. \ref{subsec:Transport}), the diffusion coefficient of species $i$ is calculated as $D_i=D_{i,0}+D_{\mathrm{bio}}=D_{\mathrm{mol},i}\cdot f_{ir}+D_{\mathrm{bio}}$ for dissolved species and $D_i=D_{\mathrm{bio}}$ for solid species. 
The bioturbation coefficient $D_{\mathrm{bio}}$ (cm$^2$ yr$^-1$) is constant in the bioturbated zone and also follows the empirical relationship by \citet{middelburg_empirical_1997}:
\begin{equation}
 D_{\mathrm{bio}} = 5.2\cdot 10^{0.76241122-0.00039724\cdot \text{depth}}\label{eq:bioturbation_coeff}
\end{equation}
Studies showed that bioturbational effects on a global scale are largely restricted to the upper 10 cm of the sediments and are only marginally related to seafloor depth \citep[e.g.][]{boudreau_mean_1998, teal_global_2010}. 
Therefore, SED (1.0) imposes a globally invariant bioturbation depth of 10cm. 
Bioirrigation can enhance the molecular diffusion coefficient $D_{i,0}=D_{\mathrm{mol},i}\cdot f_{ir}$ \citep{soetaert1996dynamic}. However, here we do not consider this effect 
and set $f_{ir}$ to a constant value of 1. The specific molecular diffusion coefficients $D_{\mathrm{mol},i}$ are corrected for sediment porosity $\phi$, tortuosity F and are linearly interpolated for an ambient temperature $T$ using zero-degree 
coefficients $D^0_i$ and temperature dependent diffusion coefficients $D^T_i$ \citep[compare ][]{gypens_simple_2008}:
\begin{equation*}
 D_{\mathrm{mol},i} = (D^0_i + D^T_i \cdot T )\cdot \frac{1}{\phi\cdot F}
\end{equation*}
Tortuosity can be expresssed in terms of porosity as $F = \frac{1}{\phi^m}$ \citep{ullman_diffusion_1982} with the exponent $m$ varying according to the type of sediment (here we use m=3). 
%\textcolor{red}{in matlab: $\phi^{tort-1}$; but see Gypens et al. (2008) the exponent is a parameter m not tortuosity...??}
Values for $D^T_i$ and $D^0_i$ are summarized in Table \ref{table:sed-charac_transport-parameters} and are adapted from \citet{Li_diffusion_1974} and \citet{gypens_simple_2008}.

%The overall reactions implemented in SED (1.0) are listed in Table \ref{table:reactions_processes}. 
The applied multi-G approach for organic matter degradation considers specific degradation rate constants $k_i$ (yr$^{-1}$) for each compound class. The degradation constants are generally taken from the coupled Earth System model 
and are assumed invariant along the sediment column, therefore independent of the nature of the terminal electron acceptor. 
The stoichiometry of organic matter is represented by the factors \chem{NC_i} and \chem{PC_i} denoting the molecular nitrogen to carbon and phosphorus to carbon ratio. 
In the sulfidic and methanic zone the 
reduction of 1 mol organic matter additionally produces 0.5 mol of hydrogen sulfide (\chem{SO_4C}) and 0.5 mol of methane (\chem{MC}). 
In the total sediment column organic matter mineralization consumes the specific terminal electron acceptor with a fixed ratio (\chem{OC}, \chem{NO_3C} and \chem{SO_4C} respectively). 
See Table \ref{table:reaction_parameters} for a complete summary of the parameters and their values.

%\textcolor{red}{Next bit from Gypens:} Re-oxidation occurs in a ratio of 1 mol of oxygen per mol of carbon anoxically mineralized. Similarly, 2 mol of oxygen
%are consumed during nitrification of \chem{NH_4} produced in the anoxic zone. As nitrification may be incomplete in the oxic layer, we similarly allow for part of the ammonium flux to escape re-oxidation.

\subsection{Module Structure}
%Sandra: Technical description, e.g. how is it implemented and how can it be coupled to model\\
\textcolor{red}{TODO: }
%Describe in which order we calculate the different profiles/exchange fluxes (first calculating OM profile, then different TEA profiles).\\ 
An analytical steady-state solution is found for the reaction-transport equation of each chemical species in each layer. 
At each boundary (i.e. $z_{\mathrm{ox}}, z_{\mathrm{bio}}, z_{\chem{NO_3}}$ and $z_{\chem{SO_4}}$) the model has to match continuity and flux for different ODE solutions of the layer above and below the specific boundary. 
In particular the bioturbation boundary is problematic as it can theoretically occur in any geochemical layer. In order to simplify this recurring boundary matching problem it is implemented in an independent algorithm 
which is described in Section \ref{subsec:GBCM}. Instructions and requirements for coupling SED (1.0) to a global Earth Sytem Model are given in Section \ref{subsubsec:ESM_coupling}.

\subsubsection{Generic boundary condition matching (GBCM)}\label{subsec:GBCM}
A general steady-state advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) diagenetic equation looks like:
\begin{align} 
 \frac{\partial C}{\partial t} &= 0 = D\frac{\partial^2C }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial C }{\partial z} - \sum_i \alpha_i \exp(-\beta_i z) - k\cdot C + Q.
\end{align}
where $z$ is the sediment depth, $t$ the time, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient and $w$ is the advection rate.\\
The ODE solution is of the general form:
\begin{align}
 C(z) &= A \exp(az) + B  \exp(bz) + \sum_i \frac{\alpha_i}{D \beta_i^2-w\beta_i-k}\cdot \exp(-\beta_i z) + \frac{Q}{k}
\end{align}
and can therefore be expressed as:
\begin{align}
C(z) = A \cdot E(z) + B \cdot F(z) + G(z) 
\end{align}
where $E(z)$, $F (z)$ are the homogeneous solutions of the ODE, G(z) the particular integral, and A, B are the integration constants.\\[1em]
Each boundary matching problem involves matching continuity and flux for the two solutions $C_U(z)$ (= 'upper') and $C_L(z)$ (= 'lower') across a boundary at $z = z_b$. Therefore, we get two ODE solutions of the genral form:
\begin{align}
C_U(z) &= A_U \cdot E_U(z) + B_U \cdot F_U(z) + G_U(z) \label{ODE_solution_U}\\
C_L(z) &= A_L \cdot E_L(z) + B_L \cdot F_L(z) + G_L(z) .\label{ODE_solution_L}
\end{align}
The two boundary conditions are: for continuity (where for generality we allow a discontinuity $V_b$) 
\begin{align}
  C_U(z_b) &= C_L(z_b) + V_b	\\
\intertext{and for flux}
 D_U C_U'(z_b) + wC_U(z_b) &=  D_LC_L'(z_b) + wC_L(z_b) + F_b
\end{align}
where $w$ is advection, $D$ are the diffusion coefficients and $F_b$ is any flux discontinuity.\\[1em]
In terms of the ODE solutions (\ref{ODE_solution_U}), (\ref{ODE_solution_L}), the boundary conditions represent two equations connecting the four integration constants:\\
\begin{equation}
 \begin{pmatrix} E_U & F_U \\ D_UE_U' & D_UF_U' \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} A_U \\ B_U \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} E_L & F_L \\ D_LE_L' & D_LF_L' \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} A_L \\ B_L \end{pmatrix} 
 + \begin{pmatrix} G_L - G_U + V_b \\ D_LG_L' - D_UG_U' + F_b - wV_b\end{pmatrix} \label{Solution_BC}
\end{equation}
where the ODE solutions $E,\ F,\ G$ are all evaluated at $z_b$.\\[1em]
Equation (\ref{Solution_BC}) can be solved to give $A_U$ and $B_U$ as a function of the integration constants from the layer below ($A_L$ and $B_L$), thereby constructing a piecewise solution for the whole region, 
with now just two integration constants $A_L$ and $B_L$. \\[1em]
In the code the function \textsf{\textbf{benthic\_utils.matchsoln}} provides this solution in the form:
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix} A_U \\ B_U \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} c_1 & c_2 \\ c_3 & c_4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} A_L \\ B_L \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} d_1 \\ d_2 \end{pmatrix} . \label{Solution_matchsoln} 
\end{equation}
Using (\ref{Solution_matchsoln}) we can now rewrite $C_U(z)$ in (\ref{ODE_solution_U}) as a function of $A_L$ and $B_L$:
\begin{equation*}
 C_U(z) = (c_1 A_L + c_2 B_L + d_1) \cdot E_U(z) + (c_3 A_L + c_4 B_L + d_2) \cdot F_U(z) + G_U(z) 
\end{equation*}
and hence define the ``transformed'' basis functions $E_U^*(z),\ F_U^*(z),\ G_U^*(z)$ such that:
\begin{equation}
 C_U(z) = A_L \cdot E_U^*(z) + B_L \cdot F_U^*(z) + G_U^*(z) \label{Solution_Upper_transformed_basis_fct}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align}
 E_U^*(z) &= c_1 E_U(z) + c_3 F_U(z) \notag\\
 F_U^*(z) &= c_2 E_U(z) + c_4 F_U(z) \label{Solution_NEW_EFG}\\
 G_U^*(z) &= G_U(z) + d_1 E_U(z) + d_2 F_U(z) \notag
\end{align}
(in the code this is done by \textsf{\textbf{benthic\_utils.xformsoln}}).

%\subsubsection*{Application in the model}\label{subsubsec:GBCM-Appl}

\subsubsection*{Solving the sediment layer stack}
Equations (\ref{Solution_matchsoln}), (\ref{Solution_Upper_transformed_basis_fct}) and (\ref{Solution_NEW_EFG}) can now be applied for each layer boundary, working up from the bottom of the sediments. 
The net result is to construct a piecewise solution with just two integration constants (coming from the lowest layer), which can then be solved for by applying one boundary condition for the sediment-water interface 
and one for the bottom of the sediments (e.g. a concentration condition at the bottom of the sediments, and a flux condition at the SWI).

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{TODO: Add figure, illustrating this e.g. for nitrate...}}% The key point here is that this is now an algorithm (rather than a fully-worked-out algebraic solution),
% which only ever has to solve a two-simultaneous-equation problem as above.

\subsubsection*{Abstracting out the bioturbation boundary}
The bioturbation boundary affects the diffusion coefficient of the modelled solutes and the conservation equation of organic matter which is available for mineralization. 
The boundary is particularly inconvenient as it can in principle occur in the middle of any ``geochemical'' layer and therefore generates multiple cases. 
To simplify this for solutes, the ``piecewise solution construction'' above is used to abstract out the bioturbation boundary. 
An initial test for each layer is made to identify its ``bioturbation-status'' (fully bioturbated, fully non-bioturbated or crossing the bioturbation boundary) and (if needed) a piecewise solution is 
constructed by matching boundary conditions across the bioturbation boundary. 
The ``outside'' code therefore never needs to know whether it is dealing with a piecewise solution (i.e. matched across a bioturbation boundary) or a ``simple'' solution (i.e. the layer is fully bioturbated
or fully non-bioturbated).\\[1em]
In the code, this is performed by \textsf{\textbf{zTOC.prepfg\_l12}} which hands back a structure \textsf{ls} containing the ``bioturbation-status'' for each layer and (if needed) 
the description of the piecewise solution (coeffcients $c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, d_1, d_2$ as above). So e.g. for sulfate, \textsf{\textbf{zTOC.prepfg\_l12}} is called three times at the beginning of \textsf{\textbf{zSO4.calcbc}} 
(one for each ``geochemical'' layer: oxic, suboxic, sulfidic) handing back three structures \textsf{ls} describing the layer's ``bioturbation-status'', abstracting away the bioturbation boundary and all associated conditional logic. 
When calculating the solutions for the different layers, the pre-calculated structure \textsf{ls} is passed to the function \textsf{\textbf{zTOC.calcfg\_l12}} which sorts out the correct
solution type to use.
