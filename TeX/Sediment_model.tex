\begin{abstract}
We present the first version of OMEN-SED (Organic Matter ENabled SEDiment model), a new, one-dimensional analytical early diagenetic model resolving organic matter cycling and 
associated biogeochemical dynamics in marine sediments designed to be coupled to Earth system models. 
% Most biogeochemical cycles and reactions in the surface sediments can be related either directly or indirectly to the degradation of organic matter (OM). 
% Despite its fundamental importance for global biogeochemical cycling, %an appropriate Earth system model of the coupled atmosphere-ocean-sediment system which is able to model all 
% %relevant processes and feedbacks over geological time-scales currently does not exist. The major problem is the high computational cost of simulating 
% %the essential redox reactions in marine sediments which are important to calculate burial of organic matter and benthic recycling fluxes of chemical compounds. 
% in most Earth system models sediment-water dynamics are  either neglected or treated in a very simplistic way. To provide a more realistic description of OM 
% degradation and nutrient cycles in marine sediments we have developed OMEN-SED, a new, one-dimensional, numerically efficient reactive transport model. 
OMEN-SED explicitly describes organic matter (\chem{OM}) cycling as well as associated dynamics of the most important terminal electron acceptors 
(i.e. \chem{O_2} , \chem{NO_3}, \chem{SO_4}) and methane (\chem{CH_4}), related reduced substances (\chem{NH_4}, \chem{H_2S}), macronutrients (\chem{PO_4}) 
and associated pore water quantities (\chem{ALK}, \chem{DIC}). Its reaction network accounts for the most important primary and secondary redox reactions, equilibrium reactions, mineral dissolution and precipitation, 
as well as adsorption and desorption processes associated with OM dynamics that affect the dissolved and solid species explicitly resolved in the model. To represent a redox-dependent sedimentary P cycle we also include 
a representation of the formation and burial of Fe-bound P and authigenic Ca-P minerals. 
Thus, OMEN-SED is able to capture the main features of diagenetic dynamics in marine sediments and, therefore, offers similar predictive abilities than a complex, numerical diagenetic model. 
Yet, its computational efficiency allows its coupling to global Earth system models and therefore the investigation of coupled global biogeochemical dynamics over a wide range of climate relevant timescales. 
This paper provides a detailed description of the new sediment 
model, as well as an extensive sensitivity analysis using a novel method which considers the entire cumulative distribution functions of the model outputs. 
In addition, OMEN-SED's performance is evaluated through comprehensive comparisons with observations and results from a more complex numerical model. 
We find solid phase and dissolved porewater profiles for different ocean depths are reproduced with good accuracy and simulated terminal electron acceptor fluxes fall well 
within the range of globally observed fluxes. Finally, we illustrate its application in an Earth system model framework by coupling OMEN-SED to the Earth system model cGENIE and tune the organic matter degradation rate constants 
to optimise the fit of simulated benthic OM contents to global observations. 
We find simulated sediment characteristics of the coupled model framework, such as OM degradation rates, oxygen penetration depths and sediment-water interface fluxes
are generally in good agreement with observations and in line with what one would expect on a global scale. 
Coupled to an Earth system model, OMEN-SED is thus a powerful tool that will not only help elucidate the role of benthic-pelagic exchange processes in the evolution and, in particular, the termination of a wide range of climate events, 
but will also allows a direct comparison of model output with the sedimentary record - the most important climate archive on Earth.

\textbf{Role of marine sediments for climate and global biogeochemical cycles:}\\
Marine surface sediments are key components in the Earth system. They host the largest carbon reservoir within the surficial Earth system, provide the primary long term sink for atmospheric \chem{CO_2}, 
recycle nutrients, and represent the most important geochemical archive used for deciphering past changes of biogeochemical cycles and climate  \citep[e.g.][]{berner:91, archer_effect_1994, ridgwell_role_2005, arndt_quantifying_2013}. 
Physical and chemical processes in sediments (i.e. diagenetic processes) depend on the water column and vice versa: Diagenesis is controlled by the external supply of solid material 
(e.g. organic matter, calcium carbonate, opal) from the water column and is affected by overlying bottom water concentrations of solutes. 
At the same time, sediments impact the water column directly either by short- and long-term storage of deposited material or diagenetic processing of deposited material and transport of terminal electron acceptors (e.g. \chem{O_2}, \chem{SO_4}) into, 
as well as metabolic products (e.g. nutrients, \chem{DIC}) to the overlying bottom waters. 
This so-called benthic-pelagic coupling is essential for understanding global biogeochemical cycles and climate \citep[e.g.][]{archer_effect_1994, archer_what_2000, soetaert_coupling_2000, mackenzie_sediments_2005}. 

Biological primary production of organic matter (OM, generally represented in its simple form \chem{CH_2O} in equation \ref{eq:photosynthesis}) and the reverse process of degradation can be written in a greatly simplified reaction as:
\begin{reaction}
\chem{CO_2}+\chem{H_2O} \rightleftharpoons \chem{CH_2O} + \chem{O_2}.\label{eq:photosynthesis}
\end{reaction}
On geological timescales, production of OM is generally greater than degradation, which results in some organic matter being buried in marine sediments and oxygen accumulating in the atmosphere. 
Thus, burial of OM deep into the sediment leads to net oxygen input to, and \chem{CO_2} removal from the atmosphere \citep{berner_phanerozoic_2004}. 
On shorter timescales, the upper few meters of the sediments, where early diagenesis occurs are specifically important, as this zone controls whether a substance is recycled 
to the water column or buried for a longer period of time in the deeper sediments \citep{hensen_benthic_2006}. 
Most biogeochemical cycles and reactions in this part of marine sediments can be related either directly or indirectly to the degradation of organic matter \citep[][]{middelburg_organic_1993, arndt_quantifying_2013}. 
Oxygen and nitrate for instance, the highest energy yielding electron acceptors, are preferentially consumed in the course of the degradation of organic matter, resulting in the release of ammonium and phosphorus to the pore water. 
As such, degradation of OM in the sediments can profoundly affect the oxygen and nutrient inventory of the ocean and thus primary productivity \citep{van_cappellen_benthic_1994, lenton_redfield_2000}. 
Furthermore, organic matter degradation releases metabolic \chem{CO_2} to the pore water, causing it to have a lower pH and carbonate ion concentration, thus provoking the dissolution of calcium carbonate \chem{CaCO_3} \citep{emerson_carbon_1981}.

% DH: more facts on sediments
%Furthermore, the sedimenst form an important sink for organic phosphorus and nitrogen. 
%Furthermore, burial of OM represents an important connection between carbon stored in more climate-relevant reservoirs like oceans, atmosphere, 
%and surficial sediments and carbon that is sequestered for much longer, geological timescales in sedimentary rock or coal \citep{mackenzie_sediments_2005, burdige_preservation_2007}. 

% \textcolor{red}{TODO include info on shelf-nutrient hypothesis:} (From Palastanga et al. 2013) 
% During  glacial  periods,  P  burial  on  shelves was likely reduced because of sea level fall, whereas the 
% erosive transfer of particulate material containing reactive P and degradable carbon from shelves to the open ocean was likely
% enhanced (Ruttenberg,1993). As a consequence, the inventory of P in the open ocean, primary productivity and CO2 
% drawdown may have increased, whereas ocean oxygen may have declined. This potential impact on productivity and CO2 
% was first brought forward by Broecker (1982) in the so-called shelf-nutrient hypothesis.

Benthic nutrient recycling from marine sediments has been suggested to play a key role for climate and ocean biogeochemistry throughout Earth history. 
For example, feedbacks between phosphorus storage and erosion from shelf sediments and marine productivity have been hypothesised to play an important role for glacial/interglacial atmospheric \chem{CO_2} changes \citep{broecker_ocean_1982, ruttenberg_reassessment_1993}. 
Furthermore, benthic nutrient recycling from anoxic sediments has been invoked to explain the occurrence of more extreme events in Earth history, for instance Oceanic Anoxic Events % by modelling and data studies 
\citep[OAEs, e.g.][]{van_cappellen_benthic_1994, mort_phosphorus_2007, tsandev_modeling_2009}. OAEs represent severe disturbances of the global carbon, oxygen and nutrient cycles of the ocean and are usually characterized 
by widespread bottom water anoxia and photic zone euxinia \citep{jenkyns_geochemistry_2010}. 
One way to explain the genesis and persistence of OAEs is increased oxygen demand due to enhanced primary productivity. Increased nutrient inputs to fuel primary productivity may in turn have come from marine sediments as the 
burial efficiency of phosphorus declines when bottom waters become anoxic \citep{ingall_evidence_1994, van_cappellen_benthic_1994}. 
The recovery from OAE like conditions is thought to involve the permanent removal of excess \chem{CO_2} from the atmosphere and ocean by burying carbon in the form of organic matter in marine sediments 
\citep[e.g.][]{arthur_geochemical_1988, jarvis_black_2011}, which is consistent with the geological record of widespread black shale formation \citep{stein_accumulation_1986}. 
Models capable of simulating not only the expansion and intensification of oxygen minimum zones, but also of predicting how the underlying sediments interact are hence needed. 
% However, the overall amount, exact timing and the rate of organic matter burial remain a topic of an ongoing debate. 
% Therefore, globally quantifying the burial and degradation of organic matter in marine sediments and related biogeochemical dynamics is important for understanding 
% climate and the cycling of many chemical elements on various timescales.

\textbf{Diagenetic Models in general:}\\
Quantifications of diagenetic processes in the sediments are possible through the application of idealised mathematical representations, or so-called diagenetic models \citep[see e.g.][]{berner_early_1980, boudreau1997diagenetic}.
%The number of research questions that can be addressed with diagenetic models is infinite and 
A plethora of different approaches have been developed, mainly following two distinct directions \citep[see][for an overview]{arndt_quantifying_2013}. 
First, state-of-the art vertically resolved numerical models simulating the entire suite of essential coupled redox and equilibrium reactions within marine sediments %that control organic matter burial and benthic recycling fluxes 
(e.g. BRNS, \citeauthor{aguilera_knowledge-based_2005}, \citeyear{aguilera_knowledge-based_2005}; 
CANDI, \citeauthor{boudreau_method--lines_1996}, \citeyear{boudreau_method--lines_1996}; MEDIA, \citeauthor{meysman_reactive_2003}, \citeyear{meysman_reactive_2003}; MUDS, \citeauthor{archer_model_2002}, \citeyear{archer_model_2002}; 
STEADYSED, \citeauthor{cappellen_cycling_1996}, \citeyear{cappellen_cycling_1996}). 
% OMEXDIA \citep{soetaert_model_1996} not included here bc mineralization processes using other oxidants (manganese oxides, iron oxides, sulphate) are here 
% lumped into one process, where degradation is only carbon limited; these terminal electron acceptors are not explicitly modeled, 
These ``complete'', multi-component steady-state or non-steady-state models, thus resolve the resulting characteristic redox-zonation of marine sediments through explicitly accounting for oxic OM degradation, 
denitrification, oxidation by manganese and iron (hydr)oxides, sulfate reduction and methanogenesis as well as the reoxidation of reduced byproducts 
\citep[i.e. \chem{NH_4}, \chem{Mn^{2+}}, \chem{Fe^{2+}}, \chem{H_2S}, \chem{CH_4}, see e.g.][]{regnier_quantitative_2011}. 
Furthermore, they incorporate various mineral dissolution and precipitation reactions, as well as fast equilibrium sorption processes for example of 
\chem{NH_4}, \chem{PO_4} and metal ions \citep[i.e. \chem{Mn^{2+}}, \chem{Fe^{2+}} and \chem{Mg^{2+}}, compare][]{cappellen_cycling_1996, meysman_reactive_2003}. 
Modelled, depth-dependent, transport processes usually comprise advection, diffusion, bioturbation and bio-irrigation.   
This group of diagenetic models generally describes OM degradation via a so-called multi-G approach \citep{joergensen_comparison_1978_2, berner_early_1980}, thus dividing the bulk organic 
matter pool into a number of compound classes that are characterised by different degradabilities $k_i$.
Alternative approaches, so-called continuum models \citep{middelburg_simple_1989, boudreau_reactive_1991}, assume a continuous distribution of reactive types but, although conceptually superior, are much less popular \citep{arndt_quantifying_2013}. 
These complex, multi-component models have a great potential for quantifying diagentic dynamics at sites where comprehensive observational data sets are available to constrain its model 
parameters \citep[see e.g.][for applications]{boudreau_comparative_1998, wang_multicomponent_1996, thullner_global_scale_2009}. 
%Combining such a complex diagenetic model with an ocean biogeochemical model results in the most realistic benthic-pelagic coupling. 
However, due to the high degree of coupled processes and depth-varying parameters, the diagenetic equation needs to be %this group of diagenetic models needs to be 
solved numerically, thus resulting in a very high computational demand and consequently rendering their application in an Earth system model (ESM) framework with a large number of grid points prohibitive. 
Additionally, their global applicability is seriously compromised by the restricted transferability of model parameters from one site to the global scale \citep{arndt_quantifying_2013}. 

The second group of diagenetic models emerged during the early days of diagenetic modelling when computing power was severely restricted \citep[e.g.][]{berner_idealized_1964}. 
These models solve the diagenetic equation analytically, thus providing an alternative and computationally more efficient approach. Finding an analytical solution, especially when complex reaction networks are to be considered, 
is not straightforward and analytical models are thus usually less sophisticated and comprehensive than numerical models and generally require the assumption of steady state conditions. 
It has been shown that the complexity of the reaction network can be reduced by dividing the sediment column into distinct zones and accounting for the most pertinent biogeochemical processes within each zone, thus increasing the likelihood 
of finding an analytical solution without oversimplifying the problem. % to Eq. (\ref{eq:Eq_generaldiagenetic}) (see Eq. (\ref{eq:ODE_general_solution}) in section \ref{subsec:GBCM} for the general steady-state solution).
Analytical approaches with distinct biogeochemical zones were implemented and used in the seventies and eighties to describe observed pore water profiles 
\citep[e.g.][]{vanderborght_vertical_1975, vanderborght_kinetic_1977, billen1982idealized, goloway_diagenetic_1982, boudreau_dependence_1984} 
% \textbf{also cite some of Bernie's work here, as well as the Schink and Guinasso Si work} 
and later for inclusion into multi-box ecosystem models \citep[e.g.][]{ruardij_benthic_1995, gypens_simple_2008} %, two-dimensional and three-dimensional regional models \citep{arndt_model_2007, capet_integrating_2016} 
%\textbf{cite Arndt and Regnier, 2007; Capet et al., 2016- although implemented in form of transfer functions}  
and global Earth system models \citep{tromp_global_1995}. 
However, in addition to the oxic zone these models generally only describe one anoxic zone explicitly, either a denitrification \citep{vanderborght_vertical_1975, billen1982idealized, goloway_diagenetic_1982, ruardij_benthic_1995, gypens_simple_2008} 
or a sulfate reduction zone \citep{boudreau_dependence_1984, tromp_global_1995}. Furthermore, the approaches of \citet{vanderborght_vertical_1975}, \citet{goloway_diagenetic_1982} and \citet{tromp_global_1995} do not explicitly account for reduced 
species (i.e. \chem{NH_4} and \chem{H_2S}, respectively). 

% From Soetart-review:  this evidence of mutual interaction between the water column and the sediment
% beneath, most biogeochemical models for water column processes either neglect the sediments or apply
% a rather crude approximation for the benthic response.

\textbf{How are sediments resolved in Earth system models:}\\
% Earth system models generally track the biogeochemical dynamics of organic and inorganic carbon, essential nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus) and oxygen with the aim of investigating the evolution 
% of the ocean's redox structure and carbonate system and its feedbacks on global climate. This general aim thus defines a minimum set of state variables and reaction processes that need to be resolved for an efficient 
% representation of the benthic-pelagic coupling in Earth system models. 
%Even though there are more appropriate sediment representations available, 
In most current ESMs sediment-water dynamics are either neglected or treated in a very simplistic way \citep{soetaert_coupling_2000, hulse_understanding_2017}. 
Most Earth system Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMICs) and also some of the higher resolution Earth system/climate models represent the sediment-water interface either as a 
reflective or a conservative/semi-reflective boundary \citep{hulse_understanding_2017}. 
Thus, all particulate material deposited on the seafloor is either instantaneously consumed (reflective boundary), or a fixed fraction is buried in the sediments (conservative/semi-reflective boundary). 
Both highly simplified approaches furthermore completely neglect the exchange of solute species through the sediment-water interface and, therefore, cannot resolve the complex benthic-pelagic coupling. 
However, due to their computational efficiency, both representations are often used in global biogeochemical models \citep[e.g.][]{najjar_impact_2007, ridgwell_marine_2007, goosse_description_2010}. 
% A superior approach is the vertically integrated dynamic model, which represents the whole sediment column as a single box \citep{hulse_understanding_2017}. Here, OM deposited on 
% the seafloor is added to the sediment box where it gets degraded and dissolved species diffuse through the sediment-water interface in accordance with these transformations. 
% This approach thus ignores the vertical extent of the sediments and the temporary storage of dissolved species \citep{soetaert_coupling_2000}. Yet, it is computationally efficient and 
% allows differentiating between various fractions of organic matter. Most EMICs incorporate a vertically integrated dynamic model for particulate inorganic carbon only 
% (i.e. mainly \chem{CaCO_3}) and just a few  consider oxic-only sediment degradation of organic matter \citep{hulse_understanding_2017}. 
Analytical diagenetic model represent the most complex description of diagenetic dynamics in Earth system models. Examples of global ESMs employing a vertically resolved diagenetic model are NorESM \citep{tjiputra_evaluation_2013} and 
HAMOCC \citep{palastanga_long_term_2011, ilyina_global_2013}, both using a version of \citet{heinze_global_1999}. None of the EMICs reviewed by \citet{hulse_understanding_2017} use such a sediment representation. 
DCESS \citep{shaffer_presentation_2008} and MBM \citep{munhoven_glacialinterglacial_2007} are box models employing a vertically resolved diagenetic model. These analytic models account for the most important transport processes 
(i.e advection, bioturbation and molecular diffusion) through basic parametrizations and include fewer biogeochemical reactions which are generally restricted to the upper, bioturbated 10\,cm of the sediments. 
%They assume that the sedimentary organic matter pool is composed of just a single compound class which is either degraded with a globally invariant degradation rate constant 
%\citep[][]{munhoven_glacialinterglacial_2007} or a fixed rate constant depending on local oxygen concentrations \citep{shaffer_presentation_2008, palastanga_long_term_2011}. 
Pore water species explicitly represented in DCESS \citep{shaffer_presentation_2008} and the HAMOCC model of \citet{heinze_global_1999} and \citet{palastanga_long_term_2011} 
are restricted to DIC, TA, \chem{PO_4} and \chem{O_2}. The MEDUSA model \citep{munhoven_glacialinterglacial_2007} considers \chem{CO_2}, \chem{HCO_3^-}, \chem{CO_3^{2-}} and \chem{O_2}. 
Other species produced or consumed during OM degradation are neglected. 
Thus, with oxygen being the only TEA explicitly modelled, the influence of reduced species is only implicitly included in the boundary conditions for \chem{O_2}. 
A newer versions of the HAMOCC model is a notable exception, as \citet{ilyina_global_2013} include \chem{NO_3} and denitrification explicitly. Furthermore, the version of 
\citet{palastanga_long_term_2011} represents an redox-dependent explicit sedimentary phosphorus cycle. Yet, reoxidation of reduced byproducts, so-called secondary redox reactions (e.g. oxidation of \chem{NH_4}, \chem{H_2S} or \chem{CH_4}), 
or sorption processes are not included in any of the discussed models. 
Furthermore, these global models assume that the sedimentary organic matter pool is composed of just a single compound class which is either degraded with a globally invariant degradation rate constant 
\citep[][]{munhoven_glacialinterglacial_2007} or a fixed rate constant depending on local oxygen concentrations \citep{shaffer_presentation_2008, palastanga_long_term_2011}. 


% Sandra review: large scale of published model parameters illustrates the complex nature of organic matter dynamics! Very difficult to find global relationships to relate model parameters 
% to available environmental characteristics, such as water depth, deposition rate. 

\textbf{Problem with that:} \\
Obviously, such a simplification of the OM pool can neither account for the observed vast structural complexity in natural organic matter and its resulting different degradation 
rates nor for the rapid decrease in OM degradability in the uppermost centimetres of the sediments \citep{arndt_quantifying_2013}. It has been suggested that at least a 3G approach 
is necessary to accurately represent organic matter dynamics in this part of the sediments where most OM is degraded \citep[e.g.][]{soetaert_model_1996}. 
Even more restrictive is the use of \chem{O_2} as the only TEA and the complete absence of reduced substances and related secondary redox reactions. 
For the majority of the modern sediments (i.e. in the deep-ocean) \chem{O_2} is the primary electron acceptor, %and \citet{archer_model_2002} found that aerobic degradation accounts for 66\% of total organic matter respiration. 
however, recent model and data studies have reported that sulfate reduction is the dominant degradation pathway on a global average 
\citep[with contributions of 55-76\%][]{canfield_aquatic_2005, jorgensen_sulfur_2006, thullner_global_scale_2009}. 
Oxygen becomes progressively less important as TEA with decreasing seafloor depth and sulfate reduction has been shown to account for 83\% of OM degradation in coastal sediments \citep{krumins_dissolved_2013}. 
In these environments most \chem{O_2} is used to reoxidise reduced substances produced during anaerobic degradation \citep{canfield_aquatic_2005, thullner_global_scale_2009}. 
Thus, the in situ production of e.g. \chem{NO_3} and \chem{SO_4} through oxidation of \chem{NH_4} and \chem{H_2S} forms an important sink for \chem{O_2} which is entirely neglected in 
current sediment representations in global models.
In addition, the lack of anoxic degradation pathways in these models limits their application to oxic oceans. Currently no analytical sediment model exists that can be used under anoxic conditions. 
Due to the lack of an appropriate sedimentary P cycle \citep[with the exception of the HAMOCC version of][]{palastanga_long_term_2011}, no current global ESM is able to model 
the redox dependent P release from marine sediments and its implications for primary productivity, global biogeochemical cycles and climate. A sediment model suitable for the coupling to an ESM and enabling a wide range of paleo questions 
to be addressed has to provide a robust quantification of organic (and inorganic) carbon burial fluxes, benthic uptake/return fluxes of oxygen, growth-limiting nutrients and reduced species, as well as anoxic degradation pathways. 
As a consequence, the reaction network must account for the most important primary and secondary redox reactions, equilibrium reactions, mineral precipitation/dissolution and adsorption/desorption, resulting in a complex set of 
coupled reaction-transport equations. 

% Even though in the current ocean these complex interactions between different degradation pathways and redox reactions are restricted to highly productive environments these processes are getting more important for other 
% time periods with more OM burial (e.g. OAEs).


\textbf{Solution presented here:}\\
Therefore, we developed the OrganicMatter ENabled SEDiment model (OMEN-SED), a new, one-dimensional, numerically efficient diagenetic model. OMEN-SED builds upon and stands in the tradition of earlier stand-alone, 
analytical diagenetic models \citep{vanderborght_kinetic_1977, billen1982idealized, goloway_diagenetic_1982, boudreau_modelling_1991}, as well as of analytical diagenetic models developed for the coupling to regional scale ecosystem or global 
Earth system models \citep{ruardij_benthic_1995, tromp_global_1995, heinze_global_1999, gypens_simple_2008}.

OMEN-SED is the first analytical model to explicitly describe OM cycling as well as associated dynamics of the most important TEAs 
(i.e. \chem{O_2}, \chem{NO_3}, \chem{SO_4}), related reduced substances (\chem{NH_4}, \chem{H_2S}), the full suite of secondary-redox reactions, macronutrients (\chem{PO_4}) and associated pore water quantities (\chem{ALK}, \chem{DIC}). 
To represent a redox-dependent sedimentary P cycle we consider the formation and burial of Fe-bound P and authigenic Ca-P minerals. % two similar to the one presented in \citet{} and \citet{palastanga_long_term_2011} is 
Thus, while OMEN-SED captures most of the features of a complex, numerical diagenetic model, its computational efficiency allows the coupling to global Earth system models and therefore the investigation of coupled global biogeochemical 
dynamics over different timescales. 
Here, the model is presented as a 2G-approach, however, OMEN-SED can be easily extended to a Multi-G approach. 
The first part of the paper provides a detailed description of OMEN-SED (Section \ref{sec:model_description}). This includes descriptions of the general model approach (Section \ref{subsec:GeneralModelApproach}), 
of the conservation equations for all explicitly represented biogeochemical tracers (Section \ref{subsec:ReactionNetwork}), as well as a summary of global relationships 
used to constrain reaction and transport parameters in OMEN-SED (Section \ref{subsec:ModelParameters}). 
In addition, a generic algorithm is described which is used to match internal boundary conditions and to determine the integration constants for the analytical solutions 
(Section \ref{subsec:Determine_IC}). 
In order to validate the stand-alone version of OMEN-SED, the second part of the paper performs an extensive sensitivity analysis for the most important model parameters and 
resulting sediment-water interface fluxes are compared with a global database (Section \ref{subsec:SA}). 
In addition, results of the stand-alone model are compared with observed pore water profiles from different ocean depths (Section \ref{subsec:SedProfiles}) and OMEN-SED 
simulations of TEA-fluxes along a typical ocean transect are compared with observations and results from a complete, numerical diagenetic model (Section \ref{subsec:globalhypsometry}). 
Thereafter, OMEN-SED is coupled to the carbon-centric version of the ``GENIE'' Earth system model \citep[cGENIE,][Section \ref{subsubsec:Methods_ESM_coupling}]{ridgwell_marine_2007}. 
Sensitivity studies are carried out using this coupled model and modelled organic matter concentrations in the surface sediments are compared to a global database \citep[][Section \ref{subsec:Parameterising_OM_rate_const}]{seiter_organic_2004}. 
We finally discuss potential applicabilities of OMEN-SED and critically analyse model limitations (Section \ref{sec:Appl_Limitations}).

\section{Model Description}\label{sec:model_description}
%OMEN-SED is a new, one-dimensional, computationally efficient reaction-transport model is designed for the coupling to regional/global biogeochemical and Earth system models. 
OMEN-SED is implemented as a FORTRAN version that can be easily coupled to any pelagic, biogeochemical model via the coupling routine \textsf{\textbf{OMEN\_SED\_main}}. 
In addition, OMEN-SED exists as a stand-alone version implemented in MATLAB and the entire model can be executed on a standard personal computer in less than 0.1 seconds. 
The source code of both, the Fortran and the MATLAB stand-alone version, as well as instructions for executing OMEN-SED and for plotting model results are available as a supplement to this paper.

The following section provides a detailed description of OMEN-SED and the fundamental equations underlying the model are highlighted. 
Tables \ref{table:reactions_processes} and \ref{table:Reaction_Network} summarise the biogeochemical reaction network and Tables \ref{table:sed-charac_transport-parameters} 
and \ref{table:reaction_parameters} provide a glossary of model parameters along with their respective units. 

\subsection {General Model Approach} \label{subsec:GeneralModelApproach}
In OMEN-SED, the calculation of benthic uptake, recycling and burial fluxes is based on the vertically resolved conservation equation for solid and dissolved species in porous media 
\citep[e.g.][]{berner_early_1980, boudreau1997diagenetic}:
\begin{equation} 
\frac{\partial \xi C_i}{\partial t}=-\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\left( -\xi D_i \frac{\partial C_i}{\partial z} +\xi w C_i\right)    +\xi \sum_j R_i^j \label{eq:Eq_generaldiagenetic}
%\frac{\partial \xi C_i}{\partial t}=-\frac{\partial F}{\partial z}+\xi \sum_j R_i^j \label{eq:Eq_generaldiagenetic}
\end{equation}
where $C_i$ is the concentration of biogeochemical species $i$, $\xi$ equals the porosity $\phi$ for solute species and $(1-\phi)$ for solid species. The term $z$ is the sediment depth, $t$ denotes the time, 
$D_i$ is the apparent diffusion coefficient of species $i$, $w$ is the burial rate  and $\sum_j R_i^j$ represents the sum of all biogeochemical rates $j$ affecting species $i$. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/Sediment-model-with-profiles.pdf}
	\caption{Schematic of the different modelled species and zones in OMEN-SED. Here showing the case $z_{\mathrm{ox}} < z_{\mathrm{bio}} < z_{\chem{NO_3}} < z_{\chem{SO_4}}$.}
	\label{fig:Sediment_layers}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

OMEN-SED accounts for both the advective, as well as the diffusive transport of solid and dissolved species. They are buried in the sediment according to a constant burial rate $w$, thus 
neglecting the effect of sediment compaction (i.e. $\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z}=0$) due to mathematical constraints. 
The molecular diffusion of dissolved species is described by Fick's law applying a species-specific apparent diffusion coefficient, $D_{\mathrm{mol},i}$.  In addition, the activity of infaunal organisms in the bioturbated zone 
is simulated using a diffusive term \citep[e.g.][]{boudreau_mathematics_1986}, with a constant bioturbation coefficient $D_{\mathrm{bio}}$ in the bioturbated zone, 
while $D_{\mathrm{bio}}$ is set to zero below the maximum bioturbation depth, $z_{bio}$. 
The pumping activity by burrow-dwelling animals and the resulting ventilation of tubes, the so-called bioirrigation, is encapsulated in a factor $f_{ir}$ that enhances the molecular diffusion coefficient 
\citep[hence, $D_{i,0}=D_{\mathrm{mol},i}\cdot f_{ir}$,][]{soetaert_model_1996}. 
% The flux divergence is thus given by:
% \begin{equation}
% \frac{\partial F}{\partial z}=-\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\left( -\xi D_i \frac{\partial C_i}{\partial z} +\xi w C_i\right) \label{Eq_flux_divergence}
% \end{equation}
% where $D_i$ is the apparent diffusion coefficient of species $i$ ($D_i=D_{i,0}+D_{\mathrm{bio}}=D_{\mathrm{mol},i}\cdot f_{ir}+D_{\mathrm{bio}}$ for dissolved species and $D_i=D_{\mathrm{bio}}$ for solid species) and $w$ is the 
% burial rate.
The reaction network of OMEN-SED accounts for the most important primary and secondary redox reactions, equilibrium reactions, mineral dissolution and precipitation, as well as adsorption and desorption processes associated with OM dynamics 
that affect the dissolved and solid species explicitly resolved in the model. Tables \ref{table:reactions_processes} and \ref{table:Reaction_Network} provide a summary of the reactions and biogeochemical tracers considered in OMEN-SED together 
with their respective reaction stoichiometries. %Table \ref{table:Reaction_Network} summarises their reaction stoichiometry and Table \ref{table:ReactionOverview} provides an overview of their description in the model.

All parameters in Eq. (\ref{eq:Eq_generaldiagenetic}) may vary with depth and many reaction rate expressions depend on the concentration of other species. 
Expressing Eq. (\ref{eq:Eq_generaldiagenetic}) for a set of chemical species thus results in a non-linear, coupled set of equations that can only 
be solved numerically. 
However, OMEN-SED is designed for the coupling to Earth system models and, therefore, cannot afford a computationally expensive numerical solution. 
Instead, similar to early, analytical diagenetic models, a computationally efficient analytical solution of Eq. (\ref{eq:Eq_generaldiagenetic}) can be derived by 1) assuming steady state conditions (i.e.$ \frac{\partial C_i}{\partial t}=0$) 
and 2) reducing the vertical variability in parameters and reaction rate expressions by dividing the sediment column into a number of functional 
biogeochemical zones \citep[Fig. \ref{fig:Sediment_layers}, compare e.g. ][for similar solutions]{billen1982idealized, goloway_diagenetic_1982, ruardij_benthic_1995, tromp_global_1995, gypens_simple_2008}. 
More specifically, OMEN-SED divides the sediment column into: I) a bioturbated and 
II) a non-bioturbated zone defined by an imposed, constant bioturbation depth $z_{\mathrm{bio}}$ (Fig. \ref{fig:Sediment_layers}). Furthermore, it resolves the dynamic redox stratification of marine sediments by dividing 
the sediment into 1) an oxic zone delineated by the oxygen penetration depth $z_{\mathrm{ox}}$; 2) a denitrification (or nitrogenous) zone situated between $z_{\mathrm{ox}}$ and the nitrate penetration depth $z_{\chem{NO_3}}$;
3) a sulfate reduction zone situated between $z_{\chem{NO_3}}$ and the sulfate penetration depth $z_{\chem{SO_4}}$; and 4) a methanogenic zone situated below $z_{\chem{SO_4}}$ (Fig. \ref{fig:Sediment_layers}).  
Although in each of these zones Eq. (\ref{eq:Eq_generaldiagenetic}) is applied with depth invariant parameters, parameter values may differ across zones. 
The biogeochemical zones are linked by stating continuity in both concentrations and fluxes at the dynamic, internal boundaries 
\citep[$z_b \in \{z_{\mathrm{bio}}, z_{\mathrm{ox}}, z_{\chem{NO_3}}, z_{\chem{SO_4}} \}$, compare e.g.][]{billen1982idealized, ruardij_benthic_1995}. Note that these boundaries are dynamic because their depth varies in response to changing ocean 
boundary conditions and forcings (see Section \ref{subsec:GBCM} for details). Furthermore, the maximum bioturbation depth is not restricted to a specific biogeochemical zone, 
hence OMEN-SED allows bioturbation to occur in the anoxic zones of the sediment (here all zones $z > z_{\mathrm{ox}}$ combined). 

The formulation of the reaction term in Eq. (\ref{eq:Eq_generaldiagenetic}) varies between zones and encapsulates the most pertinent reaction 
processes within the respective zone (see Section \ref{subsec:ReactionNetwork}), thus simplifying the mathematical description of the reaction network while 
retaining most of its biogeochemical complexity.
All consumption or production processes of dissolved species related to the degradation of organic matter are a function of the organic matter concentration. Because organic matter degradation is described as a first-order degradation, 
these processes can be expressed as a series of exponential terms ($ \sum_j \alpha_j \exp(-\beta_j z)$, see Eq. (\ref{eq:generalODE})). In addition, slow adsorption/desorption and mineral precipitation 
processes can be expressed as zero or first order (reversible) reaction ($Q$ or $k\cdot (C_i - \tilde{C})$, in Eq. (\ref{eq:generalODE})). 
Fast adsorption is described as an instantaneous equilibrium reaction using a constant adsorption coefficient $K_i$. 
The reoxidation of reduced substances is accounted for implicitly by adding a (consumption/production) flux to the internal boundary conditions 
(see Sections \ref{subsubsec:O2}, \ref{subsubsec:N} and \ref{subsubsec:S}. 
This simplification has been used previously by \citet{gypens_simple_2008} for nitrate and ammonium and can be justified as it has been shown that the 
reoxidation mainly occurs within a thin layer at the oxic/anoxic interface \citep{soetaert_model_1996}. 
The general reaction-transport equation underlying OMEN-SED is thus given by:
\begin{empheq}[box={\mybluebox[5pt]}]{equation}
  \frac{\partial C_i}{\partial t} = 0 = \frac{D_i}{1+K_i}\frac{\partial^2C_i }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial C_i }{\partial z} - \frac{1}{1+K_i} \left(  \sum_j \alpha_j \exp(-\beta_j z) + \sum_l k_l \cdot C_i - \sum_m Q_m \right) \label{eq:generalODE}
\end{empheq}
% \begin{equation} 
%  \boxed{\frac{\partial C_i}{\partial t} = 0 = D_i\frac{\partial^2C_i }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial C_i }{\partial z} - k\cdot C_i - \sum_j \alpha_j \exp(-\beta_j z) + Q} \label{eq:generalODE_orig}
%  \end{equation}
where $1/\beta_j$ can be interpreted as the length scale and $\alpha_j$ as the relative importance (or the magnitude at $z = 0$) of reaction $j$ \citep{boudreau1997diagenetic}, 
$k_l$ are generic first order reaction rate constants and $Q_m$ are zero-order (or constant) reaction rates.\\

The analytical solution of Eq. (\ref{eq:generalODE}) is of the general form:
\begin{align}
 C_i(z) &= A \cdot \exp(az) + B \cdot \exp(bz) + \sum_j \frac{\alpha_j}{D \beta_j^2-w\beta_j- \sum_l k_l}\cdot \exp(-\beta_j z) + \frac{\sum_m Q_m}{\sum_l k_l} \label{eq:ODE_general_solution_generalapproach}
\end{align}
with 
\begin{equation} 
 a = \frac{w - \sqrt{w^2+4\cdot D\cdot \sum_l k_l}}{2\cdot D}, \quad b = \frac{w + \sqrt{w^2+4\cdot D\cdot \sum_l k_l}}{2\cdot D}
\end{equation}
where $A$ and $B$ are integration constants that can be determined by applying a set of internal boundary conditions (see Section \ref{subsec:Determine_IC}).

Based on Eq. (\ref{eq:generalODE}) and its analytical solution Eq. (\ref{eq:ODE_general_solution_generalapproach}), OMEN-SED returns the fraction of particulate organic carbon (POC) buried in the sediment, 
$f_{\mathrm{POC}}$, as well as the benthic uptake/return fluxes $F_{C_i}$ of dissolved species $C_i$ (in mol cm$^{-2}$ year$^{-1}$) in response to the dynamic interplay of transport and reaction processes under changing boundary conditions and forcings:
\begin{align}
f_{\mathrm{POC}} &= \frac{\mathrm{POC}(z_\infty)}{\mathrm{POC}(0)} \label{f_POC_pres}\\
F_{C_i} &= \phi(0) \left(D_i \frac{\partial C_i(z)}{\partial z}\bigg\rvert_{z=0} - w \cdot C_i(0) \right) \label{Eq:F_Ci_SWIflux}
\end{align}
where $w$ is the deposition rate, $D_i$ is the diffusion coefficient and $\mathrm{POC}(0)$, $\mathrm{POC}(z_\infty)$, $C_i(0)$ denote the concentration of POC and dissolved species $i$ at the SWI and 
at the lower sediment boundary, respectively.


\subsection{Conservation Equations and Analytical Solution}\label{subsec:ReactionNetwork}
The following sections provide a detailed description of the conservation equations and analytical solutions for each chemical species that is resolved in this version of OMEN-SED.

\subsubsection{Organic Matter or Particulate Organic Carbon (POC)}\label{subsubsec:OM}
In marine sediments, organic matter (or in the following called particulate organic carbon, POC) is degraded by heterotrophic activity coupled to the sequential utilisation of terminal electron acceptors (TEAs) 
according to the free energy gain of the half-reaction 
\citep[$\chem{O_2} > \chem{NO_3^-}> \chem{MnO_2} > \chem{Fe(OH)_3} > \chem{SO_4^{2-}}$, e.g.][]{stumm_aquatic_2012}. Once all TEAs are depleted, organic matter is degraded via methanogenesis. 
Here, organic matter degradation is described via a multi G-model approach \citep{joergensen_comparison_1978_2}, 
dividing the bulk OM into a number $i$ of discrete compound classes $\chem{POC}_i$ characterised by class-specific first-order degradation rate constants $k_i$. 
The conservation equation for organic matter dynamics is thus given by:
\begin{equation}
 \frac{\partial \chem{POC}_i}{\partial t} = 0= D_{\chem{POC}_i} \frac{\partial^2\chem{POC}_i }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{POC}_i }{\partial z} - k_i\cdot \chem{POC}_{i} \label{eq:ODE_OC}
\end{equation}
% where:
% \begin{align}
%  D_{C_i}&=D_{\mathrm{bio}} 	 &\text{if ($z\leq z_{\mathrm{bio}}$)}\\
%  D_{C_i}&=0            &\text{if ($z > z_{\mathrm{bio}}$)} 
% \end{align}
with $D_{\chem{POC}_i}=D_{\mathrm{bio}}$ for $z\leq z_{\mathrm{bio}}$ and $D_{\chem{POC}_i}=0$ for $z > z_{\mathrm{bio}}$. 
Integration of equations \eqref{eq:ODE_OC} yields the following general solutions for the bioturbated and non-bioturbated layers:
\begin{align}
\intertext{I. Bioturbated zone ($z\leq z_{bio}$)}
 \chem{POC}_{i}^I(z) &= A_{1i}\cdot exp(a_{1i} z)+B_{1i}\cdot exp(b_{1i} z) \label{eq:GS_OM1}\\% \qquad &\text{1. Layer: ($z\leqq z_{bio}$)} \notag\\
\intertext{II. Non-bioturbated zone ($z_{bio} < z$)}
 \chem{POC}_{i}^{II}(z) &= A_{2i}\cdot exp(a_{2i} z) \label{eq:GS_OM2}%  &\text{2. Layer: ($z> z_{bio}$)} \label{eq:GS_OM2} 
\end{align}
where
\begin{equation} 
 a_{1i} = \frac{w - \sqrt{w^2+4\cdot D_{\chem{POC}_i}\cdot k_i}}{2\cdot D_{\chem{POC}_i}}, \quad b_{1i} = \frac{w + \sqrt{w^2+4\cdot D_{\chem{POC}_i}\cdot k_i}}{\cdot 2D_{\chem{POC}_i}}, \quad a_{2i} = -\frac{k_i}{w}
\end{equation}
Determining the integration constants ($A_{1,i},\ B_{1,i},\ A_{2,i}$) requires the definition of a set of boundary conditions (Table \ref{Tab:BC_OM}). 
For organic matter, OMEN-SED applies a known concentration/flux at the sediment-water interface and assumes continuity across the bottom of the bioturbated zone, $z_{\mathrm{bio}}$. 
The integration constants ($A_{1,i},\ B_{1,i},\ A_{2,i}$) are thus given by:
\begin{align}
B_{1i} &\overset{\mathrm{BC 1)}}{=} \chem{POC}_{0i} - A_{1i} \label{POC_IntConst_B1i}\\
A_{2i} &\overset{\mathrm{BC 2)}}{=} \frac{A_{1i}\cdot exp(a_{1i} z_{bio}^-)+B_{1i}\cdot exp(b_{1i} z_{bio}^-)}{exp(a_{2i} z_{bio}^+)}\notag\\
A_{1i} &\overset{\mathrm{BC 3)}}{=} - \frac{B_{1i}b_{1i}\cdot exp(b_{1i} z_{bio}^-)}{a_{1i} \cdot exp(a_{1i} z_{bio}^-)}\notag
\end{align}


See Section \ref{subsec:GBCM} for further details on how to find the analytical solution.

\subsubsection{Oxygen}\label{subsubsec:O2}
OMEN-SED explicitly accounts for oxygen consumption by the aerobic degradation of organic matter within the oxic zone, as well as the oxidation of reduced species (i.e. \chem{NH_4}, \chem{H_2S}) 
produced in the anoxic zones of the sediment. 
In the oxic zone ($z<z_{ox}$), the aerobic degradation consumes oxygen with a fixed \chem{O_2:C} ratio (\chem{O_2C}, Tab. \ref{table:reaction_parameters}). 
A predefined fraction, $\gamma_\chem{NH_4}$, of the ammonium produced during the aerobic degradation of OM is nitrified to nitrate, consuming two moles of oxygen per mole of ammonium produced. 
In addition, OMEN-SED implicitly accounts for the oxygen consumption due to oxidation of reduced species (\chem{NH_4}, \chem{H_2S}) produced below the oxic zone through the flux boundary condition at the dynamically calculated 
(see section \ref{subsubsec:Stoich_reaction_params} for details) oxygen penetration depth $z_{\mathrm{ox}}$. 
%This simplification can be justified as it has been shown that these secondary redox reactions mainly occur at the oxic/anoxic interface \citep{soetaert_model_1996}. 
All oxygen consumption processes can thus be formulated as a function of organic matter degradation. 
The conservation equation for oxygen is given by: 
\begin{align} 
 \frac{\partial \chem{O_2}}{\partial t} = 0 &= D_{\chem{ \chem{O_2}}}\frac{\partial^2  \chem{O_2} }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial  \chem{O_2}}{\partial z} - \frac{1-\phi}{\phi}\sum_i k_i \cdot [ \chem{O_2C} + 2 \gamma_{\chem{NH_4}} \chem{NC_i} ]\cdot \chem{POC}_{i}(z) \label{eq:ODE_O2_1}
\intertext{For illustrative purposes, we here substitute the analytical solution for the POC depth profile and provide the analytical solution. The remaining paragraphs only outline the general equation, whose analytical solution can be derived in an 
identical manner. Substituting Eq. (\ref{eq:GS_OM1}) and (\ref{eq:GS_OM2}) for \chem{POC_i(z)} and Eq. (\ref{POC_IntConst_B1i}) for $B_{1i}$ gives:}

\end{align}
where $D^I_{\chem{ \chem{O_2}}}$ and $D^{II}_{\chem{ \chem{O_2}}}$ denote the \chem{O_2} diffusion coefficient for the bioturbated and non-bioturbated zone, respectively. 
The term $\frac{1-\phi}{\phi}$ accounts for the volume conversion from solid to dissolved phase and \chem{NC_i} is the nitrogen to carbon ratio in POC.

Determining the four integration constants ($A_{\chem{O_2}}^1,\, B_{\chem{O_2}}^1,\, A_{\chem{O_2}}^2,\, B_{\chem{O_2}}^2$, see Section \ref{subsec:Determine_IC} for details), as well as the \textit{a priori} unknown oxygen penetration 
depth requires the definition of five boundary conditions (see Table \ref{Tab:BC_O2}). 
At the sediment-water interface, OMEN-SED applies a Dirichlet condition (i.e. known concentration) and assumes concentration and flux continuity across the bottom of the bioturbated zone, $z_{\mathrm{bio}}$. 
The oxygen penetration depth $z_{\mathrm{ox}}$ marks the lower boundary and is dynamically calculated as the depth at which $\chem{O_2}(z)=0$. 
Therefore, OMEN-SED applies a Dirichlet boundary condition $\chem{O_2}(z_{\mathrm{ox}})=0$. In addition, a flux boundary is applied that implicitly accounts for the oxygen consumption by the partial oxidation 
of $\chem{NH_4}$ and $\chem{H_2S}$ diffusing into the oxic zone from below (BC 4.2, Table \ref{Tab:BC_O2}). It is assumed that respective fractions ($\gamma_{\chem{NH_4}}$ and $\gamma_{\chem{H_2S}}$) are directly reoxidised 
at the oxic/anoxic interface and the remaining fraction escapes reoxidation. OMEN-SED iteratively solves for $z_{\mathrm{ox}}$ by first testing if there is oxygen left at $z_\infty$ (i.e. $\chem{O_2}(z_\infty) > 0$). If that is not the case, it determines the root for the flux 
boundary condition 4.2 (Table \ref{Tab:BC_O2}). If $z_{\mathrm{ox}}=z_\infty$,  a zero diffusive flux boundary condition is applied as lower boundary condition.

\subsubsection{Nitrate and Ammonium}\label{subsubsec:N}
Nitrogen dynamics in OMEN-SED are controlled by the metabolic production of ammonium, nitrification, denitrification as well as ammonium adsorption. 
Ammonium is produced by organic matter degradation in both the oxic and anoxic zones, while denitrification consumes nitrate in the denitrification zone with a fixed \chem{NO_3:C} ratio (\chem{NO_3C}, Tab. \ref{table:reaction_parameters}). 

The adsorption of ammonium to sediment particles is formulated as an equilibrium process with constant equilibrium adsorption coefficient $K_\chem{NH_4}$, thus assuming that the adsorption is fast compared to the 
characteristic time scales of transport processes \citep{wang_multicomponent_1996}. In addition, a defined fraction, $\gamma_{\chem{NH_4}}$, of metabolically produced ammonium is directly nitrified to nitrate in the oxic zone, 
while the nitrification of upward diffusing ammonium produced in the sulfidic and methanic zones is implicitly accounted for in the boundary conditions. The conservation equations for ammonium and nitrate are thus given by:

\begin{align}
\intertext{1. Oxic zone ($z \leq z_{\mathrm{ox}}$)}
 \frac{\partial \chem{NO_3}^I}{\partial t} &= 0 = D_\chem{NO_3} \frac{\partial^2\chem{NO_3}^I }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{NO_3}^I }{\partial z} + \gamma_{\chem{NH_4}} \frac{1-\phi}{\phi} \cdot \sum_i \chem{NC_i} \cdot k_i \cdot \chem{POC}_{i}(z)\label{eq:NO3_ODE1_L1}\\ %\qquad &\text{1. Layer ($z\leq z_{\mathrm{ox}}$)}\\
 \frac{\partial \chem{NH_4}^I}{\partial t} &= 0 = \frac{D_{\chem{NH_4}}}{1+K_\chem{NH_4}} \frac{\partial^2\chem{NH_4}^I }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{NH_4}^I }{\partial z} + \frac{1-\gamma_{\chem{NH_4}}}{1+K_\chem{NH_4}}\cdot \frac{1-\phi}{\phi} \cdot \sum_i \chem{NC_i} \cdot k_i \cdot \chem{POC}_{i}(z)\label{eq:NH4_ODE1_L1}\\
 \intertext{2. Denitrification (or nitrogenous) zone ($z_{\mathrm{ox}} < z \leq z_{\chem{NO_3}}$)} 
\frac{\partial \chem{NO_3}^{II}}{\partial t} &= 0 = D_{\chem{NO_3}} \frac{\partial^2\chem{NO_3}^{II} }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{NO_3}^{II} }{\partial z} - \frac{1-\phi}{\phi} \chem{NO_3C} \cdot \sum_i k_i \cdot \chem{POC}_{i}(z) \label{eq:NO3_ODE1_L2}\\
\frac{\partial \chem{NH_4}^{II}}{\partial t} &= 0 = \frac{D_{\chem{NH_4}}}{1+K_\chem{NH_4}} \frac{\partial^2\chem{NH_4}^{II} }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{NH_4}^{II} }{\partial z} \label{eq:NH4_ODE1_L2}
 \intertext{3. Sulfidic and methanic zone ($z_{\chem{NO_3}} < z \leq z_\infty$)} 
\frac{\partial \chem{NH_4}^{III}}{\partial t} &= 0 = \frac{D_{\chem{NH_4}}}{1+K_\chem{NH_4}} \frac{\partial^2\chem{NH_4}^{III} }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{NH_4}^{III} }{\partial z} + \frac{1}{1+K_\chem{NH_4}}\cdot\frac{1-\phi}{\phi} \cdot \sum_i \chem{NC_i} \cdot k_i \cdot \chem{POC}_{i}(z)\label{eq:NH4_ODE1_L3}
\end{align}

where $D_\chem{NO_3}$ and $D_{\chem{NH_4}}$ denote the diffusion coefficients for \chem{NO_3} and \chem{NH_4} which depend on the bioturbation status of the respective geochemical zone (compare Section \ref{subsec:GBCM}).

Integration of Eq. (\ref{eq:NO3_ODE1_L1}) - (\ref{eq:NH4_ODE1_L3}) yields the analytical solutions, which are not further developed here but follow the procedure outlined in Section \ref{subsubsec:O2} for oxygen 
(also see Section \ref{subsec:GBCM} for more details on how to find the analytical solution). Table \ref{Tab:BC_NO3+NH4} summarises the boundary conditions applied in OMEN-SED to solve Eq. (\ref{eq:NO3_ODE1_L1}) - (\ref{eq:NH4_ODE1_L3}) 
and to find the \textit{a priori} unknown nitrate penetration depth, $z_\chem{NO_3}$. 
The model assumes known bottom water concentrations for both \chem{NO_3} and \chem{NH_4}, the complete consumption of nitrate at the nitrate penetration depth (in case  $z_{\chem{NO_3}} < z_\infty$) and no change in %nitrate and 
ammonium flux at $z_\infty$. In addition, concentration and diffusive flux continuity across $z_{\mathrm{bio}}$ and $z_{\mathrm{ox}}$ is considered for \chem{NO_3} and \chem{NH_4}. 
Furthermore, the reoxidation of upward-diffusing reduced ammonium is accounted for in the oxic-anoxic boundary condition for nitrate and ammonium. 
OMEN-SED iteratively solves for $z_{\chem{NO_3}}$ by first testing if there is nitrate left at $z_\infty$ (i.e. $\chem{NO_3}(z_\infty) > 0$) and, otherwise, by finding the root for the flux 
boundary condition 6.2 (Table \ref{Tab:BC_NO3+NH4}).

\subsubsection{Sulfate and Sulfide}\label{subsubsec:S}
Below the denitrification zone ($z>z_{\chem{NO_3}}$), organic matter degradation is coupled to sulfate reduction, consuming sulfate and producing hydrogen sulfide with a fixed \chem{SO_4:C} ratio (\chem{SO_4C}, Tab. \ref{table:reaction_parameters}). 
In addition, the anaerobic oxidation of upward diffusing methane (AOM) produced below the sulfate penetration and the associated consumption of sulfate and production of sulfide; as well as the production of sulfate and 
consumption of sulfide through sulfide oxidation are implicitly accounted for through the boundary conditions (Table \ref{Tab:BC_SO4+H2S}).
The conservation equations for sulfate and sulfide are thus given by:

\begin{align}
\intertext{1. Oxic and nitrogenous zone ($z \leq z_{\chem{NO_3}}$)}
 \frac{\partial \chem{SO_4}^I}{\partial t} &= 0 = D_{\chem{SO_4}} \frac{\partial^2\chem{SO_4}^I }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{SO_4}^I }{\partial z} \label{eq:SO4_ODE1_L1}\\ %\qquad &\text{1. Layer ($z\leq z_{\mathrm{ox}}$)}\\
 \frac{\partial \chem{H_2S}^I}{\partial t} &= 0 = D_{\chem{H_2S}} \frac{\partial^2\chem{H_2S}^I }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{H_2S}^I }{\partial z}\label{eq:H2S_ODE1_L1}\\
 \intertext{2.Sulfidic zone ($z_{\chem{NO_3}} < z \leq z_{\chem{SO_4}}$)} 
\frac{\partial \chem{SO_4}^{II}}{\partial t} &= 0 = D_{\chem{SO_4}} \frac{\partial^2\chem{SO_4}^{II} }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{SO_4}^{II} }{\partial z} - \frac{1-\phi}{\phi} \cdot \sum_i \chem{SO_4C} \cdot k_i \cdot \chem{POC}_{i}(z) \label{eq:SO4_ODE1_L2}\\
\frac{\partial \chem{H_2S}^{II}}{\partial t} &= 0 = D_{\chem{H_2S}} \frac{\partial^2\chem{H_2S}^{II} }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{H_2S}^{II} }{\partial z} + \frac{1-\phi}{\phi} \cdot \sum_i \chem{SO_4C}  \cdot k_i \cdot \chem{POC}_{i}(z)\label{eq:H2S_ODE1_L2}
 \intertext{3. Methanic zone ($z_{\chem{SO_4}} < z \leq z_{\infty}$)} 
\frac{\partial \chem{H_2S}^{III}}{\partial t} &= 0 = D_{\chem{H_2S}} \frac{\partial^2\chem{H_2S}^{III} }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{H_2S}^{III} }{\partial z}\label{eq:H2S_ODE1_L3}
\end{align}

% and $i \in \{$SO$_4$, H$_2$S$\}$. 
where $D_\chem{SO_4}$ and $D_{\chem{H_2S}}$ denote the diffusion coefficients for \chem{SO_4} and \chem{H_2S} which depend on the bioturbation status of the respective geochemical zone (compare Section \ref{subsec:GBCM}). 
Integration of Eq. (\ref{eq:SO4_ODE1_L1}) - (\ref{eq:H2S_ODE1_L3}) yields the analytical solution and Table \ref{Tab:BC_SO4+H2S} summarises the boundary conditions applied. 
OMEN-SED assumes known concentrations at the sediment-water interface and continuity across the bioturbation depth and the nitrate penetration depth. 
The reoxidation of reduced \chem{H_2S} to \chem{SO_4} is accounted for implicitly via the oxic-anoxic boundary condition for both species, while reduction of \chem{SO_4} and the associated production of \chem{H_2S} via AOM 
is accounted for through the respective boundary conditions at $z_\chem{SO_4}$. In case $z_{\chem{SO_4}}<z_\infty$, OMEN-SED assumes zero sulfate concentration at $z_{\chem{SO_4}}$ and its diffusive flux must equal the amount of 
methane produced below (with a methane to carbon ratio of \chem{MC}); or, in case $z_{\chem{SO_4}}=z_\infty$, a zero diffusive flux condition for sulfate is considered. 
OMEN-SED iteratively solves for $z_{\chem{SO_4}}$ by first testing if there is sulfate left at $z_\infty$ (i.e. $\chem{SO_4}(z_\infty) > 0$) and, otherwise, by finding the root for the flux 
boundary condition 8.2 (Table \ref{Tab:BC_SO4+H2S}). At the lower boundary $z_\infty$ zero diffusive flux of \chem{H_2S} is considered.

\end{figure}

The biogeochemical description of phosphorus (P) dynamics builds on earlier models developed by \citet{caroline_p_slomp_key_1996} and accounts for phosphorus recycling through organic matter degradation, adsorption onto sediments and 
iron(III) hydroxides (Fe-bound P), as well as carbonate fluorapatite (\chem{CFA} or authigenic P) formation (see Figure \ref{fig:P-cycle} for a schematic overview of the sedimentary P cycle). 
In the oxic zone of the sediment, \chem{PO_4} liberated through organic matter degradation can adsorb 
to iron(III) hydroxides forming Fe-bound P \citep[or \chem{FeP},][]{slomp1998role}. Below the oxic zone,  \chem{PO_4} is not only produced via organic matter degradation but can also be released from the Fe-bound P pool due to the 
reduction of iron(III) hydroxides under anoxic conditions. Furthermore, in these zones phosphate concentrations build up and pore waters can thus become supersaturated with respect to carbonate fluorapatite, 
thus triggering the authigenic formation of \chem{CFA} \citep{cappellen_mathematical_1988}. Phosphorus bound in these authigenic minerals represents a permanent sink for reactive phosphorus \citep{caroline_p_slomp_key_1996}. 
As for ammonium, the adsorption of P to the sediment matrix is treated as an equilibrium processes, parameterised with dimensionless adsorption coefficients for the oxic and anoxic zone, 
respectively \citep[$K_\chem{PO_4}^{\mathrm{ox}}$, $K_\chem{PO_4}^{\mathrm{anox}}$][]{slomp1998role}. 
The sorption and desorption of P to iron(III) hydroxides as well as the authigenic fluorapatite formation are described as first-order reactions with rate constants $k_s$, $k_m$ and $k_a$, respectively (Table \ref{table:reaction_parameters}). 
The rate of the respective process is calculated as the product of the rate constant and the difference between the current concentration (of \chem{PO_4} and \chem{FeP}) and an equilibrium or asymptotic concentration \citet{caroline_p_slomp_key_1996}. 
The asymptotic Fe-bound P concentration is $\chem{FeP}^\infty$ and the equilibrium concentration for P sorption and authigenic fluorapatite formation are $\chem{PO_4}^s$ and $\chem{PO_4}^a$, respectively (Table \ref{table:reaction_parameters}). 
The last term in Eq. (\ref{eq:PO4_ODE_L1}) and (\ref{eq:M_ODE_L1}) represents sorption of \chem{PO_4} to \chem{FeP} in the oxic zone, the last term in 
Eq. (\ref{eq:M_ODE_L2}) and (\ref{eq:PO4_ODE_L2}) is the release of \chem{PO_4} from the \chem{FeP} pool and the 4th term in Eq. (\ref{eq:PO4_ODE_L2}) represents the permanent 
loss of \chem{PO_4} to authigenic fluorapatite formation. 
The conservation equations for phosphate and Fe-bound P are thus given by:
\begin{align}
\intertext{1. Oxic zone ($z \leq z_{\mathrm{ox}}$)}
 \frac{\partial \chem{PO_4}^I}{\partial t} &= \frac{D_{\chem{PO_4}}}{1+K_\chem{PO_4}^{\mathrm{ox}}} \frac{\partial^2\chem{PO_4}^I }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{PO_4}^I }{\partial z} + \frac{1-\phi}{\phi}\frac{1}{1+K_\chem{PO_4}^{\mathrm{ox}}}\sum_i

 \intertext{2. Anoxic zones ($z_{\mathrm{ox}} < z \leq z_{\infty}$)} 
 \frac{\partial \chem{FeP}^{II}}{\partial t} & = D_{\chem{FeP}}\frac{\partial^2\chem{FeP}^{II} }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{FeP}^{II} }{\partial z} - k_{m}(\chem{FeP}^{II} - \chem{FeP}^\infty)\label{eq:M_ODE_L2}\\

					\left( \chem{PC}_i \cdot k_i \cdot \chem{POC}_{i}(z) \right) \notag\\
					& - \frac{k_{a}}{1+K_\chem{PO_4}^{\mathrm{anox}}}(\chem{PO_4}^{II}-\chem{PO_4}^a) + \frac{(1-\phi)}{\phi}\frac{k_{m}}{1+K_\chem{PO_4}^{\mathrm{anox}}}(\chem{FeP}^{II}-\chem{FeP}^\infty)\label{eq:PO4_ODE_L2}
\end{align}
% where
% \begin{align}
%  D_{\chem{PO_4}}&=D_{\chem{PO_4}, 0}+D_{\mathrm{bio}} &\text{ and }\quad D_{\chem{FeP}}&= D_{\mathrm{bio}} &\text{if ($z\leq z_{\mathrm{bio}}$)}\\
%  D_{\chem{PO_4}}&=D_{\chem{PO_4}, 0} &\text{ and }\quad D_{\chem{FeP}}&= 0 &\text{if ($z > z_{\mathrm{bio}}$)} 
% \end{align}
where $D_\chem{PO_4}$ denotes the diffusion coefficient for \chem{PO_4} which depends on the bioturbation status of the respective geochemical zone and 
$D_{\chem{FeP}}=D_{\mathrm{bio}}$ for $z\leq z_{\mathrm{bio}}$ and $D_{\chem{FeP}}=0$ for $z > z_{\mathrm{bio}}$ (compare Section \ref{subsec:GBCM}). 
Integration of Eq. (\ref{eq:PO4_ODE_L1}) - (\ref{eq:PO4_ODE_L2}) yields the analytical solution and Table \ref{Tab:BC_PO4+M} summarises the boundary conditions applied in OMEN-SED.
The model assumes known bottom water concentrations and equal concentrations and diffusive fluxes at $z_{\mathrm{bio}}$ and $z_{\mathrm{ox}}$ for both species. 
Additionally OMEN-SED considers no change in phosphate flux and an asymptotic Fe-bound P concentration at $z_\infty$.
%A no flux boundary condition is applied at $z_\infty$.

\subsubsection{Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC)}\label{subsubsec:DIC}
OMEN-SED accounts for the production of dissolved inorganic carbon (\chem{DIC}) through organic matter degradation, as well as methane oxidation. 
Organic matter degradation produces dissolved inorganic carbon with a stoichiometric \chem{DIC:C} ratio of 1:2 in the methanic zone and 1:1 in the rest of the sediment column (\chem{DICC^{II}} and \chem{DICC^{I}} respectively). 
\chem{DIC} production through methane oxidation is implicitly taken into account through the boundary condition at $z_{\chem{SO_4}}$. 
A mechanistic description of \chem{DIC} production from \chem{CaCO_3} dissolution %is in coastal marine significantly smaller than its production from OM degradation \citep{krumins_dissolved_2013} and 
would lead to significant mathematical problems and is therefore not included in the current version of OMEN-SED. 
The conservation equations for \chem{DIC} are thus given by:
\begin{align}
\intertext{1. Oxic, nitrogenous and sulfidic zone ($z \leq z_{\chem{SO_4}}$)}
  \frac{\partial \chem{DIC}^I}{\partial t} &= 0 = D_{\chem{DIC}} \frac{\partial^2\chem{DIC}^I }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{DIC}^I }{\partial z} + \frac{1-\phi}{\phi} \cdot \sum_i \chem{\chem{DIC}C^I} \cdot k_i \cdot \chem{POC}_{i}(z)\label{eq:DIC_ODE1_L1}\\ %\qquad &\text{1. Layer ($z\leq z_{\mathrm{ox}}$)}\\
 \intertext{2. Methanic zone ($z_{\chem{SO_4}} < z \leq z_\infty$)} 
  \frac{\partial \chem{DIC}^{II}}{\partial t} &= 0 = D_{\chem{DIC}} \frac{\partial^2\chem{DIC}^{II} }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{DIC}^{II} }{\partial z} + \frac{1-\phi}{\phi} \cdot \sum_i \chem{\chem{DIC}C^{II}} \cdot k_i \cdot \chem{POC}_{i}(z)\label{eq:DIC_ODE1_L2} %\qquad &\text{1. Layer ($z\leq z_{\mathrm{ox}}$)}\\
\end{align}
where $D_\chem{\chem{DIC}}$ denotes the diffusion coefficient for \chem{DIC} which depends on the bioturbation status of the respective geochemical zone. 
Integration of Eq. (\ref{eq:DIC_ODE1_L1}) and (\ref{eq:DIC_ODE1_L2}) yields the analytical solution and Table \ref{Tab:BC_DIC} summarises the boundary conditions applied in OMEN-SED. 
A Dirichlet condition is applied at the sediment-water interface. In addition, the model assumes a zero diffsive flux through the lower boundary $z_\infty$ and continuity across the bottom of the bioturbated zone, as well as the sulfate penetration depth. An additional flux boundary condition at $z_{\chem{SO_4}}$, implicitly accounts for DIC production through anaerobic oxidation of methane  (Table \ref{Tab:BC_DIC} Eq. 5).

\subsubsection{Alkalinity}\label{subsubsec:ALK}
Organic matter degradation and secondary redox reactions exert a complex influence on alkalinity  \citep[e.g.][]{jourabchi_quantitative_2005, wolf-gladrow_total_2007, krumins_dissolved_2013}. 
To model alkalinity, OMEN-SED divides the sediment column is into four geochemical zones, 
where different equations describe the biogeochemical processes using variable stoichiometric coefficients (compare values in Table \ref{table:reaction_parameters}). 
Above $z_{\mathrm{ox}}$, the combined effects of \chem{NH_4} and \chem{P} release due to aerobic OM degradation increases alkalinity according to $\chem{ALK}^\mathrm{OX}$ whereas nitrification decreases alkalinity with stoichiometry 
$\chem{ALK}^\mathrm{NIT}$. 
In the remaining three zones anaerobic OM degradation generally results in an increase in alkalinity, with the exact magnitude depending on the nature of the terminal electron acceptor used 
(i.e. $\chem{ALK}^\mathrm{DEN}$, $\chem{ALK}^\mathrm{SUL}$, $\chem{ALK}^\mathrm{MET}$). In addition, the effect of secondary redox reactions, such as nitrification, sulfide and methane oxidation are implicitly accounted for in the boundary conditions. 
Note that the alkalinity description in the current version of OMEN-SED does not account for \chem{CaCO_3} dissolution/precipitation due to the mathematical complexity of the problem.
In OMEN-SED, the conservation equations for alkalinity are thus given by:
\begin{align}
 \intertext{1. Oxic zone ($z \leq z_{\chem{ox}}$)} 
\frac{\partial \chem{ALK}^{I}}{\partial t} &= 0 = D_{\chem{ALK}} \frac{\partial^2\chem{ALK}^{I} }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{ALK}^{I} }{\partial z} \notag\\
					  & + \frac{1-\phi}{\phi} \cdot \sum_i \left( \chem{ALK}^\mathrm{NIT} \cdot \frac{\gamma_{\chem{NH_4}}}{1+K_\chem{NH_4}} \chem{NC_i} + \chem{ALK}^\mathrm{OX}\right)\cdot k_i \cdot \chem{POC}_{i}(z) \label{eq:ALK_ODE1_L1}\\
 \intertext{2. Dentrification or nitrogenous zone ($z_{\chem{ox}} < z \leq z_{\chem{NO_3}} $)} 
\frac{\partial \chem{ALK}^{II}}{\partial t} &= 0 = D_{\chem{ALK}} \frac{\partial^2\chem{ALK}^{II} }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{ALK}^{II} }{\partial z} + \frac{1-\phi}{\phi} \cdot \sum_i \chem{ALK}^\mathrm{DEN}\cdot k_i \cdot \chem{POC}_{i}(z)\label{eq:ALK_ODE1_L2}
 \intertext{3. Sulfidic zone ($z_{\chem{NO_3}} < z \leq z_{\chem{SO_4}} $)} 
\frac{\partial \chem{ALK}^{III}}{\partial t} &= 0 = D_{\chem{ALK}} \frac{\partial^2\chem{ALK}^{III} }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{ALK}^{III} }{\partial z} + \frac{1-\phi}{\phi} \cdot \sum_i \chem{ALK}^\mathrm{SUL}\cdot k_i \cdot \chem{POC}_{i}(z)\label{eq:ALK_ODE1_L3}
 \intertext{4. Methanic zone ($z_{\chem{SO_4}} < z \leq z_{\infty} $)} 
\frac{\partial \chem{ALK}^{IV}}{\partial t} &= 0 = D_{\chem{ALK}} \frac{\partial^2\chem{ALK}^{IV} }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial \chem{ALK}^{IV} }{\partial z} + \frac{1-\phi}{\phi} \cdot \sum_i \chem{ALK}^\mathrm{MET}\cdot k_i \cdot \chem{POC}_{i}(z)\label{eq:ALK_ODE1_L4}
\end{align}
where $D_\chem{\chem{ALK}}$ denotes the diffusion coefficient for alkalinity which depends on the bioturbation status of the respective geochemical zone. 
Integration of Eq. (\ref{eq:ALK_ODE1_L1}) - (\ref{eq:ALK_ODE1_L4}) yields the analytical solution and Table \ref{Tab:BC_ALK} summarises the boundary conditions applied in OMEN-SED. 
A Dirichlet boundary condition is applied at the sediment-water interface. The decrease of alkalinity due to oxidation of reduced species produced in the anoxic zones 
(with stoichiometry $\chem{ALK}^\mathrm{NIT}$ and $\chem{ALK}^\mathrm{H_2S}$) is implicitly taken into account through the flux boundary condition at $z_{\mathrm{ox}}$ (Table \ref{Tab:BC_ALK} Eq. 5). 
Furthermore, the oxidation of methane by sulfate reduction increases alkalinity with stoichiometry $\chem{ALK}^\mathrm{AOM}$ which is accounted for through the flux boundary condition at $z_{\chem{SO_4}}$ (Table \ref{Tab:BC_ALK} Eq. 9). 
At the lower boundary $z_\infty$ a zero diffusive flux condition is applied.

\subsection{Determination of Integration Constants}\label{subsec:Determine_IC}

The integration constants of all general analytical solutions derived above change in response to changing boundary conditions. Thus, OMEN-SED has to re-determine integration constants for each dynamic zone 
(i.e. $z_{\mathrm{ox}}, z_{\mathrm{bio}}, z_{\chem{NO_3}}$ and $z_{\chem{SO_4}}$) at every time step for all biogeochemnical species. The bioturbation boundary poses a particular challenge as it can theoretically occur in any of the dynamic geochemical 
zones (Fig. \ref{fig:Boundary_matching_algo}). Therefore, in order to generalise and simplify this recurring boundary matching problem, an independent, generic algorithm (Generic Boundary Condition Matching) is implemented (rather than using multiple fully-worked-out algebraic solutions for each possible case and every biogeochemical species). 
As a consequence, the algorithm only has to solve a two-simultaneous-equation problem.

\subsubsection{Generic Boundary Condition Matching (GBCM)}\label{subsec:GBCM}
% A general steady-state transport-reaction equation for the set of coupled reaction-tansport equations for a generic tracer $C$ implemented in OMEN-SED can be formulated as:
% 
% \begin{align} 
%  \frac{\partial C}{\partial t} &= 0 = D\frac{\partial^2C }{\partial z^2} - w\frac{\partial C }{\partial z} - k\cdot C - \sum_i \alpha_i \exp(-\beta_i z) + Q \label{eq:generalODE}
% \end{align}
% where $t$ is time, $z$ is sediment depth, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, $w$ is advection rate and $k$ a generic reaction rate constant. 
% The inhomogeneous reaction (production/consumption) of tracer $C$ is described by $g(z) = \alpha_i \exp(-\beta_i z) + Q$, where $Q$ is a zeroth-order (or constant) rate of $C$ reaction, $\alpha_i$ can be interpreted as 
% the relative importance and $1/\beta_i$ as the length scale of reaction $i$ \citep{boudreau1997diagenetic}. 

As discussed in Section \ref{subsec:GeneralModelApproach}, the solution of the general steady-state transport-reaction equation (Eq. (\ref{eq:generalODE})) for a generic 
species $C$ is of the general form:
\begin{align}
 C(z) &= A \exp(az) + B  \exp(bz) + \sum_j \frac{\alpha_j}{D \beta_j^2-w\beta_j-k}\cdot \exp(-\beta_j z) + \frac{Q}{k} \label{eq:ODE_general_solution}
\end{align}
% %>>>
% \marginnote{\textbf{DH}: Should it be $D \beta_i^2+w\beta_i-k$ in the denom. - see \citet{boudreau1997diagenetic} Exp 6-13 Eq. 6.121}[-1.5cm]%<<<
% %>>>
and can therefore be expressed as:
\begin{align}
C(z) = A \cdot E(z) + B \cdot F(z) + G(z) 
\end{align}
where $E(z)$, $F (z)$ are the homogeneous solutions of the ODE, G(z) the particular integral (collectively called the basis functions), and A, B are the integration constants that must be determined using the boundary conditions 
(shown in Fig. \ref{fig:Boundary_matching_algo} for the whole sediment column).

Each internal boundary matching problem (i.e. excluding $z=0$ and $z=z_\infty$) involves matching continuity and flux for the two solutions of the respective 
reaction-transport equation above, $C_U(z)$ (= 'upper'), and below, $C_L(z)$ (= 'lower'), the dynamic boundary at $z = z_b$:
\begin{align}
C_U(z) &= A_U \cdot E_U(z) + B_U \cdot F_U(z) + G_U(z) \label{ODE_solution_U}\\
C_L(z) &= A_L \cdot E_L(z) + B_L \cdot F_L(z) + G_L(z) .\label{ODE_solution_L}
\end{align}
OMEN-SED generally applies concentration continuity and flux boundary conditions at its internal, dynamic boundaries: \\
Continuity (where for generality we allow a discontinuity $V_b$) 
\begin{align}
  C_U(z_b) &= C_L(z_b) + V_b	\\
\intertext{Flux}
 D_U C_U'(z_b) + wC_U(z_b) &=  D_LC_L'(z_b) + wC_L(z_b) + F_b
\end{align}
where $w$ is advection, $D$ are the diffusion coefficients and $F_b$ is any flux discontinuity (e.g. resulting from secondary redox reactions).\\[1em]
Considering that the advective flux above and below the boundary is equal (i.e. $wC_U(z_b) = wC_L(z_b)$) and substituting the general ODE solutions (\ref{ODE_solution_U}), (\ref{ODE_solution_L}), 
the boundary conditions can be represented as two equations connecting the four integration constants:
\begin{equation}
 \begin{pmatrix} E_U & F_U \\ D_UE_U' & D_UF_U' \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} A_U \\ B_U \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} E_L & F_L \\ D_LE_L' & D_LF_L' \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} A_L \\ B_L \end{pmatrix} 
 + \begin{pmatrix} G_L - G_U + V_b \\ D_LG_L' - D_UG_U' + F_b - wV_b\end{pmatrix} \label{Solution_BC}
\end{equation}
where the ODE solutions $E,\ F,\ G$ are all evaluated at $z_b$.\\[1em]
Equation (\ref{Solution_BC}) can now be solved to give $A_U$ and $B_U$ as a function of the integration constants from the layer below ($A_L$ and $B_L$), thereby constructing a piecewise solution for both layers, 
with just two integration constants (this is implemented in the function \textsf{\textbf{benthic\_utils.matchsoln}} of OMEN-SED): % $A_L$ and $B_L$. \\[1em]
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix} A_U \\ B_U \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} c_1 & c_2 \\ c_3 & c_4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} A_L \\ B_L \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} d_1 \\ d_2 \end{pmatrix} . \label{Solution_matchsoln} 
\end{equation}
Using Eq. (\ref{Solution_matchsoln}), $C_U(z)$ in (\ref{ODE_solution_U}) can now be rewritten as a function of $A_L$ and $B_L$ (implemented in  \textsf{\textbf{benthic\_utils.xformsoln}})):
\begin{equation}
 C_U(z) = (c_1 A_L + c_2 B_L + d_1) \cdot E_U(z) + (c_3 A_L + c_4 B_L + d_2) \cdot F_U(z) + G_U(z)  \label{Eq:Sol_Upper_rewritten}
\end{equation}
and hence define the ``transformed'' basis functions $E_U^*(z),\ F_U^*(z),\ G_U^*(z)$ such that:
\begin{equation}
 C_U(z) = A_L \cdot E_U^*(z) + B_L \cdot F_U^*(z) + G_U^*(z) \label{Solution_Upper_transformed_basis_fct}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align}
 E_U^*(z) &= c_1 E_U(z) + c_3 F_U(z) \notag\\
 F_U^*(z) &= c_2 E_U(z) + c_4 F_U(z) \label{Solution_NEW_EFG}\\
 G_U^*(z) &= G_U(z) + d_1 E_U(z) + d_2 F_U(z) \notag
\end{align}

%\subsubsection*{Application in the model}\label{subsubsec:GBCM-Appl}

Equations (\ref{Solution_matchsoln}), (\ref{Solution_Upper_transformed_basis_fct}) and (\ref{Solution_NEW_EFG}) can now be consecutively applied for each of the dynamic biogeochemical zone boundaries (Fig. \ref{fig:Boundary_matching_algo}), 
starting at the bottom of the sediment column. The net result is a piecewise solution of the whole sediment column with just two integration constants (coming from the lowest layer), which can then be solved for by applying the boundary 
conditions at the sediment-water interface and the bottom of the sediments. 

\subsubsection{Abstracting out the bioturbation boundary}
The bioturbation boundary affects the diffusion coefficient of the modelled solutes, as well as the conservation equation of organic matter (and thereby the exact form of each reaction-transport equation). 
This boundary is particularly inconvenient as it can, in principle, occur in the middle of any of the dynamically shifting biogeochemical zones and therefore generate multiple cases 
(Fig. \ref{fig:Boundary_matching_algo}). 
The GBCM algorithm described above is thus not only used to construct a piecewise solution of the whole sediment column, but also to abstract out the bioturbation boundary. 
For each biogeochemical zone the "bioturbation-status'' is initially tested (i.e. fully bioturbated, fully non-bioturbated, or crossing the bioturbation boundary). 
Therefore, the upper and lower boundaries for the different zones (e.g. for the nitrogenous zone: $z_U = z\mathrm{ox}$, $z_L = z_\chem{NO_3}$), as well as the respective reactive terms and diffusion coefficients 
(bioturbated and non-bioturbated) are passed over to the routine \textsf{\textbf{zTOC.prepfg\_l12}} where the bioturbation-status is determined. In case the bioturbation depth is located within this zone 
(i.e. $z_U < z_\mathrm{bio} < z_L$) a piecewise solution for this layer is constructed. Therefore, the reactive terms and diffusion coefficients are handed over to the routines \textsf{\textbf{zTOC.calcfg\_l1}} and 
\textsf{\textbf{zTOC.calcfg\_l2}} which calculate the basis functions ($E_U, F_U, G_U$ and  $E_L, F_L, G_L$) and their derivatives for the bioturbated and the non-bioturbated part of this specific geochemical zone. 
The concentration and flux for both solutions at $z_\mathrm{bio}$ are matched and the coefficients $c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, d_1, d_2$ (as in Eq. (\ref{Solution_matchsoln})) are calculated by the routine 
\textsf{\textbf{benthic\_utils.matchsoln}}. These coefficients and the "bioturbation-status'' of the layer are passed back to the main GBCM algorithm where they can be used by the routine \textsf{\textbf{benthic\_utils.xformsoln}} 
to calculate the ``transformed'' basis functions ($E_U^*(z),\ F_U^*(z),\ G_U^*(z)$) such that both layers are expressed in the same basis (compare Eq. (\ref{Eq:Sol_Upper_rewritten} - \ref{Solution_NEW_EFG}). 
% These new basis functions are now used in the main GBCM algorithm, which therefore never needs to know whether it is dealing with a piecewise solution (i.e. matched across a bioturbation boundary) or a ``simple'' 
% solution (i.e. the layer is fully bioturbated or fully non-bioturbated). 

For instance, in the case of sulfate, \textsf{\textbf{zTOC.prepfg\_l12}} is called three times before the actual profile is calculated (once per zone: oxic, nitrogenous, sulfidic) 
and hands back the information about the ``bioturbation-status'' of the three layers and the coefficients $c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, d_1, d_2$ for the biogeochemical zone including the bioturbation depth. 
When calculating the complete piecewise solution for the sediment column, this information is passed to the function \textsf{\textbf{zTOC.calcfg\_l12}} which sorts out the correct solution type to use. 
The main GBCM algorithm therefore never needs to know whether 
it is dealing with a piecewise solution (i.e. matched across the bioturbation boundary) or a ``simple'' solution (i.e. the layer is fully bioturbated or fully non-bioturbated). 


\subsection{Model Parameters}\label{subsec:ModelParameters}
The following section provides a summary of  global relationships used to constrain reaction and transport parameters in OMEN-SED. Table \ref{table:sed-charac_transport-parameters} 
synthesises sediment and transport parameters, while Tab. \ref{table:reaction_parameters} provides an overview of all biogeochemical parameters used in OMEN-SED.

\subsubsection{Transport Parameters}
The burial of sediments and pore water is directly related to the accumulation of new material on the seafloor \citep[i.e. sedimentation,][]{burdige2006geochemistry}. 
This results in a downward advective flux of older sediment material and pore water in relation to the sediment-water interface. When coupled to an ocean model, its sedimentation flux can be readily used in OMEN-SED. 
The stand-alone version of OMEN-SED uses the empirical global relationship between sediment accumulation rate ($w$ in cm yr$^{-1}$) and seafloor depth ($z$ in m) of \citet{middelburg_empirical_1997}: 
\begin{equation}
 w = 3.3\cdot 10^{-0.87478367-0.00043512\cdot z}\label{eq:sedimentation_rate}.
\end{equation}
As an option we include the parameterisation of \citet{burwicz_estimation_2011} 
\begin{equation}
 w = \frac{w_1}{1 + (\frac{z}{z1})^{c1}} + \frac{w_2}{1 + (\frac{z}{z2})^{c2}}\label{eq:sedimentation_rate_Burwicz}
\end{equation}
with parameter values as found in the original study (i.e. $w_1=0.117$\,cm yr$^{-1}$, $w_2=0.006$\,cm yr$^{-1}$, $z1=200$\,m, $z2=4000$\,m, $c1=3$, $c2=10$).
As mentioned before (Section \ref{subsec:GeneralModelApproach}), the diffusion coefficient of species $i$ is calculated as $D_i=D_{i,0}+D_{\mathrm{bio}}=D_{\mathrm{mol},i}\cdot f_{ir}+D_{\mathrm{bio}}$ for dissolved species and $D_i=D_{\mathrm{bio}}$ for solid species. 
The bioturbation coefficient $D_{\mathrm{bio}}$ (cm$^2$ yr$^-1$) is constant in the bioturbated zone and also follows the empirical relationship by \citet{middelburg_empirical_1997}:
\begin{equation}
 D_{\mathrm{bio}} = 5.2\cdot 10^{0.76241122-0.00039724\cdot z}\label{eq:bioturbation_coeff}
\end{equation}
Observations indicate that bioturbation is largely restricted to the upper 10 cm of the sediments and is only marginally related to seafloor depth \citep[e.g.][]{boudreau_mean_1998, teal_global_2010}. 
Therefore, OMEN-SED imposes a globally invariant bioturbation depth $z_{\mathrm{bio}}$ of 10 cm. In case the bottom water oxygen concentration is below 5 nmol cm$^{-3}$ \textcolor{red}{REF for it???} \textbf{??? email nils?}
infaunnal activity is assumed to cease and $z_{\mathrm{bio}} = 0.01$ cm. We choose a low value unequal to zero in order to simplify the implementation of the model. 
This approach ensures that the sediment column always consists of a bioturbated (even though very small for the low oxygen condition) and a non-bioturbated zone, 
thus the same GBCM algorithm can be used to solve the conservation equations. Furthermore, when OMEN-SED is coupled to an Earth system model 
the same method can be used to convert the POC depositional flux into a SWI concentration (i.e. the flux needs to be converted assuming bioturbation, see Section \ref{subsubsec:Methods_ESM_coupling}). 

Bioirrigation (i.e the pumping activity by burrow-dwelling animals) exchanges burrow water with overlying water and may enhance the SWI-flux of solutes \citep{aller_importance_1984, aller1988benthic}. 
Several approaches exist to incorporate this into a 1-D diagenetic model, for instance as a non-local transport/exchange process \citep{boudreau_equivalence_1984, emerson_sediment-water_1984} 
or as an enhancement factor of the molecular diffusion coefficient \citep{devol_benthic_1993, soetaert_model_1996}. In OMEN-SED the latter approach is applied and the 
apparent ``bio-diffusion'' coefficient is calculated as $D_{i,0}=D_{\mathrm{mol},i}\cdot f_{ir}$. 
\citet{soetaert_model_1996} derived an empirical relationship between $f_{ir}$ and seafloor depth ($f_{ir} = \mathrm{Min}\{1; 15.9\cdot z^{-0.43}\}$) 
based on observations from \citet{archer_benthic_1992} and \citet{devol_benthic_1993}. As this relationship just varies for depth above $\sim$623 m (with a maximum 
value of 3 at $\sim$50 m) a constant value of $f_{ir}=1$ is used in the default OMEN-SED configuration. 
%However, here we do not consider this effect as it is difficult to constrain on geological timescales and set $f_{ir}$ to a constant value of 1 . 
The specific molecular diffusion coefficients $D_{\mathrm{mol},i}$ are corrected for sediment porosity $\phi$, tortuosity F and are linearly interpolated for an ambient 
temperature $T$ using zero-degree coefficients $D^0_i$ and temperature-dependent diffusion coefficients $D^T_i$ \citep[][]{soetaert_model_1996}:
\begin{equation*}
 D_{\mathrm{mol},i} = (D^0_i + D^T_i \cdot T )\cdot \frac{1}{\phi\cdot F}.
\end{equation*}
Tortuosity can be expressed in terms of porosity as $F = \frac{1}{\phi^m}$ \citep{ullman_diffusion_1982} with the exponent $m$ varying according to the type of sediment (here $m=3$ is used representing muddy sediments with high porosity). 
%\textcolor{red}{in matlab: $\phi^{tort-1}$; but see Gypens et al. (2008) the exponent is a parameter m not tortuosity...??}
Values for $D^T_i$ and $D^0_i$ are summarised in Table \ref{table:sed-charac_transport-parameters} and are adapted from \citet{Li_diffusion_1974}, \citet{schulz_quantification_2006} and \citet{gypens_simple_2008}.

\subsubsection {Stoichiometries and reaction parameters}\label{subsubsec:Stoich_reaction_params}
%The parameters relating to organic matter %The overall reactions implemented in OMEN-SED are listed in Table \ref{table:reactions_processes}. 
The first-order organic matter degradation constants of compound class $i$, $k_i$ (yr$^{-1}$), are assumed invariant along the sediment column and therefore independent of the nature 
of the terminal electron acceptor. The rate constants can be altered manually to fit observed sediment profiles (compare modelled profiles in Section \ref{subsec:SedProfiles}) or related to a master variable 
provided by a coupled Earth system model (e.g. sedimentation rate, see Section \ref{subsec:Parameterising_OM_rate_const}). 
The partitioning of the bulk OM pool into reactivity classes ($f_i$) needs to be specified manually in the stand-alone version or can be provided by the ESM. 
Organic matter degradation releases N, P and DIC to the pore water using Redfield molar ratios \citep{redfield1963influence} and consumes TEA with specific stoichiometries (\chem{O_2C}, \chem{NO_3C}, \chem{SO_4C}) as summarised in Table \ref{table:reaction_parameters}. 
Table \ref{table:Reaction_Network} in the appendix provides a list of reactions and their stoichiometries as implemented in OMEN-SED. 
The effect of OM degradation and secondary redox reactions on total alkalinity is also accounted for via reaction specific stoichiometries representing the release of \chem{NH_4}, \chem{H_2S} and P and is based on \citet[][]{jourabchi_quantitative_2005}. 
%Based on \citet{jourabchi_quantitative_2005} we assume that aerobic organic matter degradation increases alkalinity by 1 mole per mole ammonium released and decreases alkalinity by 2 mole per mole P released \citep{}.
In reality, the reoxidation of reduced substances produced during OM degradation may be incomplete. Yet, in OMEN-SED we have to assume their complete, instantaneous reoxidation at $z_\mathrm{ox}$ to allow for an analytical solution. 
In order to relax this assumption, for cases where it can be justified, we include a ``switch'' to allow part of the \chem{NH_4}, \chem{H_2S} and \chem{CH_4} flux to escape reoxidation. % in order to relax the simplifying assumption when needed. 
The secondary redox parameters (i.e. $\gamma_{\chem{NH_4}}$, $\gamma_{\chem{H_2S}}$, $\gamma_{\chem{CH_4}}$) therefore account for the fraction of reduced substances that are reoxidised and 
%and are thus a ``switch'' included for cases where a relaxation of the ``all reoxidised'' assumption can be justified. 
would be ideally parameterised for instance in relation to bottom water oxygen concentration or oxygen penetration depth ($z_{\mathrm{ox}}$). 
\citet{gypens_simple_2008} for example expressed $\gamma_{\chem{NH_4}}$ as a function of oxygen penetration depth ($\gamma_{\chem{NH_4}} = 0.243 \cdot \mathrm{ln}(z_{\mathrm{ox}}) + 1.8479$) 
based on a fitting exercises to a numerical model and showed that the fraction varies between 0.2 for $z_{\mathrm{ox}}=0.1$cm and 1.0 for $z_{\mathrm{ox}}>3$cm. 
Due to mathematical constraints in OMEN-SED for finding an analytical solution to the model equations these fractions take constant values generally representing oxygenated deep sea conditions. 
% \textbf{SA: they are just build in to allow for the escape of reduced species- see Gypens et al., 2008. there are no reference but evidence that some H2S, NH4 can escape oxidation. We assume an instantaneous re-oxidation at sox, 
% but reality is that this is a reaction-transport problem. So if reaction timescales< transport timescales (e.g. a lot of competition for O2), some NH4 escapes. so this possibility is build in if wanted, e.g. observed. 
% This is a parameter that just comes in because of the simplifying assumption of "everything is oxidised at zox"}
The instantaneous equilibrium adsorption coefficients of \chem{NH_4} and \chem{PO_4} ($K_{\chem{NH_4}}$, $K_\chem{PO_4}^{\mathrm{ox}}$, $K_\chem{PO_4}^{\mathrm{anox}}$) are based on \citet{wang_multicomponent_1996} and \citet{slomp1998role}, respectively.
The first order rate constants for sorption of \chem{PO_4} to Fe oxides ($k_s$), release of \chem{PO_4} from Fe-bound P due to Fe-oxide reduction ($k_m$) and 
authigenic CFA precipitation ($k_a$), as well as the pore water equilibrium concentrations for P sorption and CFA precipitation 
($\chem{PO_4}^s$, $\chem{PO_4}^a$ ) and the asymptotic concentration for Fe-bound P ($\chem{FeP}^\infty$ ) are taken from  \citet{caroline_p_slomp_key_1996}. 
See Table \ref{table:reaction_parameters} for a complete summary of the parameters and their values.

%are constrained on the basis of ??. The pore water equilibrium concentrations for P sorption and CFA precipation 
%($\chem{PO_4}^s$, $\chem{PO_4}^a$ ) and the asymptotic concentration for Fe-bound P ($\chem{FeP}^\infty$ ) are taken from  \citet{palastanga_long_term_2011}. 
%The phosphorus to carbon ratio represents the composition of organic matter and is chosen as ?? based on ??.\\

% In the sulfidic and methanic zone the 
% reduction of 1 mol organic matter additionally produces 0.5 mol of hydrogen sulfide (\chem{SO_4C}) and 0.5 mol of methane (\chem{MC}) respectively.

\subsection{Sensitivity Analysis}\label{subsec:SA}
\subsubsection{Methodology}
Model parameters implicitly account for processes that are not explicitly resolved. They are notoriously difficult to constrain and thus a primary source of uncertainty for numerical and analytical models - in particular 
on the global scale and/or in data-poor areas. 
A comprehensive sensitivity analysis can help quantify this uncertainty and identify the most sensitive parameters. More specifically, sensitivity analysis is used to investigate how the variations in the outputs 
($y_1,\ ...,\ y_N$) of a model can be attributed to variations in the different input parameters \citep[$x_1,\ ...,\ x_M$,][]{pianosi_sensitivity_2016}. 
Different types of sensitivity indices, which quantify the relative influence of parameter $x_i$ on output $y_j$ with a scalar $S_{i,j}$ 
(for $i \in \{1,\ ...,\ M \}$ and $j \in \{1,\ ...,\ N \}$), can be calculated, ranging from simple one-at-a-time methods to statistical evaluations of the output 
distribution \citep[e.g. variance-based or density-based approaches][]{pianosi_sensitivity_2016}. The latter indices 
%are easy to interpret and can be compared across different parameters and/or different model outputs as they generally 
take values between zero and one ($S_{i,j} \in [0, 1]$), where zero indicates a non-influential parameter and a higher value a more influential parameter. 
Here, sensitivity analysis is used mainly to identify which parameters have the largest impact on the different model outputs and therefore require more careful calibration. 
% and if there is any factor whose variability has a negligible effects on specific outputs?
%Due to OMEN-SED's computational efficiency we are able to apply one of the approaches requiring higher numbers of model evaluations to compute the sensitivity index.  
As the probability density functions of our model outputs (i.e. the resulting SWI-fluxes) are generally highly-skewed towards extreme organic matter degradation rates (not shown) variance-based sensitivity indices 
may not be a suitable proxy for output uncertainty \citep{pianosi_sensitivity_2016}. 
Hence, instead the density-based PAWN method by \citet{pianosi_simple_2015} is employed which considers the entire conditional and unconditional Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the model output
rather than its variance only. The unconditional CDF, $F_y(y)$, of output $y$ is obtained when all uncertain parameters ($x_1,\ ...,\ x_M$) are varied simultaneously, 
and the conditional CDFs, $F_{y|x_i}(y)$, are obtained when all inputs but the $i$-th parameter are varied (i.e. $x_i$ is fixed to a so-called conditioning value). 
The sensitivity index of parameter $i$ is measured by the distance between the two CDFs using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic 
\citep{kolmogorov1933sulla, smirnov1939estimation}, i.e.:
\begin{equation}
 S_i = \max_{x_i} \max_{y} | F_y(y) - F_{y|x_i}(y) |.
\end{equation}
%where $F_y(y)$ is the unconditional CDF of the output $y$ and $F_{y|x_i}(y)$ represents the conditional CDF when the $i$-th parameter is fixed to the conditioning value. 
Since $F_{y|x_i}(y)$ accounts for what happens when the variability due to $x_i$ is removed, the distance between the two CDFs provides a measure of the effects of
$x_i$ on the output $y$. 
Due to the model complexity it is impossible to compute the sensitivity indices analytically. Therefore, they are approximated from a Latin-Hypercube sampling of parameter 
inputs and calculated outputs.
For a brief description of the methodology, see Fig. \ref{fig:Sensitivity_Analysis_methodology}. For more details, we refer the interested reader to \citet{pianosi_simple_2015}.

The PAWN method, as implemented within the Sensitivity Analysis for Everyone (SAFE) matlab toolbox \citep{pianosi_matlab_2015}, is used to investigate M = 11 model parameters for ranges as specified in Table \ref{table:SA_parameter_ranges}. 
Sensitivity indices for all resulting SWI-fluxes for two idealised sediment conditions (i.e. anoxic at 400\,m and oxic at 4000\,m, see Table \ref{table:SA_2Cases}) are calculated. 
We use NU = 200 samples to estimate the unconditional CDF, NC = 100 samples to estimate the conditional CDFs and n = 10 conditioning points. 
Thus as $\chem{N_{eval}}=200+100\cdot10\cdot11$, 11200 model evaluations are performed for each sediment condition. 
The resulting indices are then translated into a color code and summarised in a pattern plot to simplify comparison (Fig. \ref{fig:Sensitivity_Analysis}).

\subsubsection{Results}
%\section{Sensitivity Analysis}\label{subsec:SA}
Fig. \ref{fig:Sensitivity_Analysis} summarises results of the sensitivity analysis as a colour map. 
Results indicate that generally the most significant parameters for all model outputs are the degradation rate constant for the labile OM pool ($k_1$) and the fraction of this pool to the total OM stock ($f_1$). 
Other parameters play a minor role for the SWI-fluxes, with the exception of the secondary redox parameters (i.e. $\gamma_\chem{NH_4},\ \gamma_\chem{H_2S}$) in the oxic scenario.
Here, \chem{NH_4}, \chem{SO_4} and \chem{H_2S} are very sensitive to changes in $\gamma_\chem{NH_4}$ and $\gamma_\chem{H_2S}$, as these parameters determine how much of the respective TEA is produced in situ via reoxidation, 
thus affecting the resulting SWI-fluxes. 
For the oxic scenario, the reoxidation of \chem{H_2S} produced in the sulfidic layer also has a strong influence on alkalinity ($\gamma_\chem{H_2S}$, Table \ref{Tab:BC_ALK} Eq. 5) 
as it decreases alkalinity by 2 moles per mole of \chem{S} oxidized ($\chem{ALK}^\mathrm{H_2S}$, Table \ref{table:reaction_parameters}). 
However, these high sensitivities are partially caused by the wide range of allowed values ($\gamma_{\chem{NH_4}}$,\ $\gamma_{\chem{NH_4}} \in [0.5; 1.0]$). Yet, for oxic deep sea conditions it is more
likely that reduced substances are almost completely reoxidised \citep[e.g.][]{hensen_benthic_2006}. 
For the anoxic scenario the secondary redox parameters are essentially non-influential as no \chem{O_2} is available for the reoxidation of reduced substances. 
Especially for the oxic condition the $\chem{PO_4}$ SWI-flux appears to be insensitive to P-related parameters (i.e. $K_\chem{PO_4}^\mathrm{ox}$, $K_\chem{PO_4}^\mathrm{anox}$, $k_s$, $k_m$, $k_a$) as the majority is absorbed to $\chem{Fe}$-oxides. 
The sensitivities change if other $\chem{PO_4}$ related equilibrium concentrations $\chem{PO_4}^s$, $\chem{PO_4}^a$ and $\chem{FeP}^\infty$ are used (not shown).
Overall the results of the sensitivity analysis are in line with what one would expect from a diagenetic model and thus provide ground to confirm that OMEN-SED provides sensible results.
The parameterisation of the organic matter pools ($f_1$) and their degradation rate constants ($k_1$, $k_2$) is critical especially when the model is used in a global Earth system model framework, as 
these parameters, as well as the $\gamma$-parameters, can have a very important influence on the flux of dissolved species through the SWI. At the same time these are the weakest constrained parameters. 
%The high sensitivities of the $\gamma$-parameters for the oxic scenario are partially caused by the wide range of allowed values ($\gamma_{\chem{NH_4}}$,\ $\gamma_{\chem{NH_4}} \in [0.5; 1.0]$). For oxic deep sea conditions it is more
%likely that reduced substances are almost completely reoxidised \citep[e.g.][]{hensen_benthic_2006}. 
Thus, one should rather choose $\gamma$-values close to 1 and consider carefully where a relaxation of the 
``all reoxidised'' assumption is appropriate. In contrast, the importance of the OM degradation rate constants can not be overemphasised. Therefore, much care should be given to how 
these are parameterised in coupled simulations and a range of different plausible scenarios should be tested to quantify uncertainty. 

% \textbf{agree- as said before you should include more concluding statements- OM parametrisation is critical for these global models and gamma values (adsorption coefficients for different species too, but those are generally okieh constrained) 
% can have very important influence on flux of reduced species through SWI. At the same time these are the weakest constrained parameters. Also get back to this point when discussing the transect -gamma- and the coupling- k. Gamma is probably a 
% bit overrepresented here, because you allow it to vary between 0 and 1- basically all escapes to nothing. A more realistic range would be almost all- all. Thus gamma is introduced by the simplification and the deliberate relaxation of the 
% simplification we allow for and then its role is overstressed because of its unconstrained nature. But one does not have to put up with this because you can also set it to "all consume" and assume that this is realistic enough.So gamma is only a 
% switch include for cases where you can justify a relaxation of that assumption.OM degradation parameters are the holly grail! They are hugely important- one cannot overstate their importance, but very very poorly defined. The basic parametrisation 
% of all other processes is not that critical, but it is vital to have a good handle on OM degradation parameters and think hard about gamma. So much care should be given to how these are parametrised in coupled simulations and I'd probably always 
% recommend to run a range of different,plausible k- and gamma scenarios to quantify uncertainty.  }

Because of the strong sensitivity of model results on OM degradation rate parameters, we further explore the sensitivity of simulated sediment-water exchange fluxes to variations in organic matter degradation parameters by varying $k_1$, $f_1$ and $\widetilde{k_2}$ while all other model 
parameters are set to their default values (Tables \ref{table:sed-charac_transport-parameters} and \ref{table:reaction_parameters}). Minimum and maximum values for $k_1$, $\widetilde{k_2}$ and $f_1$ in 
the shallow ocean are as in Table \ref{table:SA_parameter_ranges}. 
For the deep sea condition we account for the presence of more refractory OM by sampling $f_1 \in [0.02, 0.3]$, whereas the variation of $k_1$ and $\widetilde{k_2}$ is as in the shallow ocean. 
The parameter space is sampled using another Latin-Hypercube approach with sample sizes of $N=3500$ for each idealised sediment condition. 
Figure \ref{fig:SA_Color_ScatterPlots} summarises the results of the sensitivity study and the ranges of observed $\chem{O_2}$ and $\chem{NO_3}$ sediment-water interface 
fluxes extracted from a global database \citep{stolpovsky_toward_2015} are indicated on the colour scale. The colour patterns in Figure \ref{fig:SA_Color_ScatterPlots} A and B reveal the complex interplay between the amount of labile OM $f_1$ and 
its degradation rate $k_1$ for the resulting SWI-fluxes of \chem{NO_3} in anoxic sediments and \chem{O_2} in aerobic sediments. 
In general, a higher degradation rate in combination with more labile OM available leads to a higher SWI-flux. 
However, higher fluxes extend over a larger range of $k_1$-values when the amount of labile OM $f_1$ is high. 
The absence of a colour pattern in Figure \ref{fig:SA_Color_ScatterPlots} C highlights the limited interaction of the two model parameters for \chem{NO_3} SWI-fluxes under oxic conditions. 
Figure \ref{fig:SA_Color_ScatterPlots} shows that SWI-fluxes can vary widely over the range of plausible organic matter degradation parameters and that simulated fluxes generally fall within the range of observed SWI-fluxes. 
However, a large number of different k-f combinations can result in SWI-fluxes that fall within the observed ranges reported by \citet{stolpovsky_toward_2015} further emphasising the care that should be devoted to constraining OM degradation parameters.

\subsection{Case study: Simulations of sediment cores}\label{subsec:SedProfiles}
\subsubsection{Methodology}
In order to illustrate the capabilities of OMEN-SED, comprehensive datasets from the Santa Barbara Basin \citep{reimers_porewater_1996}, as well as from the Iberian margin and the Nazar\'e Canyon \citep{epping_oxidation_2002} 
are modelled. Modelled profiles are compared with measured pore water data from different depths including the continental shelf (108\,m) and the lower slope (2213\,m) located at the Iberian margin,
the upper slope (585\,m) from the Santa Barbara Basin, and a deep sea site (4298\,m) in the Nazar\'e Canyon. 
The Santa Barbara Basin is characterised by anoxic bottom waters, high POC concentrations and varved sediments \citep{reimers_seasonal_1990}, therefore the depth of bioturbation in OMEN-SED 
is restricted to the upper 0.01 cm. In the uppermost sediments iron(III) hydroxides are reduced, releasing \chem{Fe^{2+}} which reacts with sulfide to form iron sulfides. 
Thus, the \chem{Fe} cycle exerts a strong control on sulfide concentrations in the sediments of this basin \citep{reimers_porewater_1996}. 
In addition, the sediments are generally supersaturated with respect to carbonate fluorapatite by and below 2 cm \citep{reimers_porewater_1996}. 
The Iberian margin, situated in the northeastern Atlantic, generally belongs to the more productive regions of the global ocean \citep{longhurst_estimate_1995}, however, seasonal changes in upwelling creates a strong temporal variability in 
primary productivity and organic carbon deposition. Submarine canyons in this area (like the Nazar\'e Canyon) may deliver organic carbon from the shelf to the ocean interior \citep{van_weering_recent_2002, epping_oxidation_2002}.
For a more detailed description of the study areas and the experimental work, the interested reader is referred to the publications by \citet{reimers_porewater_1996} and \citet{epping_oxidation_2002}. 

In OMEN-SED sediment characteristics and boundary conditions are set to the observed values where available (Table \ref{table:Profiles_BC}). Other sediment characteristics (e.g. sedimentation rate, porosity, density), 
stoichiometric factors and secondary reaction parameters are set to the default value (see Tables \ref{table:sed-charac_transport-parameters} and \ref{table:reaction_parameters}).
Organic matter is modelled as two fractions, with different first-order degradation rate constants. 
The POC and pore water profiles were manually fitted by optimizing the POC partitioning into the fast and slow degrading pool and their respective first-order degradation rate constants (priority is given to reproduce the POC 
and \chem{O_2} profiles). For phosphorus the equilibrium concentration for authigenic P formation (\chem{PO_4^a}) was adjusted to fit the \chem{PO_4} concentration at $z_\infty$.

\subsubsection{Results}
%\subsection{Stand-alone simulation of sediment cores}\label{subsec:SedProfiles}
Fig. \ref{fig:Sediment_profiles} compares modelled and observed sediment profiles for the Santa Barbara Basin and the Iberian margin. Results show 
that OMEN-SED is able to capture the main diagenetic features across a range of different environments without changing model parameters (other than the 4 we tuned, i.e. $k_1$, $k_2$, $f_1$ and \chem{PO_4^a}) %(e.g. stoichiometric ratios or secondary reaction parameters) 
to site specific conditions. 
For the two open Iberian margin stations (108 and 2213 m) OMEN-SED fits all observations well. OMEN-SED does especially well at seafloor depth (SFD) 2213 m by reproducing the deep \chem{O_2} penetration and the subsurface maximum in \chem{NO_3} 
concentration due to the nitrification of \chem{NH_4} (note, that \chem{NH_4} is overestimated at this SFD). 
For the anoxic Santa Barbara Basin (585 m) the decrease in \chem{SO_4} and the increase in \chem{ALK} concentration with sediment depth is well represented, indicating the 
importance of sulfate reduction as the primary pathway of OM degradation at this site \citep[compare with][]{meysman_reactive_2003}. 
However, a misfit is observed for \chem{H_2S} and \chem{PO_4} in the upper 20 cm of this sediment core. The discrepancy for \chem{H_2S} can be explained by high iron(III) hydroxide concentrations, 
which is reduced to degrade organic matter (especially in the $2-4$ cm depth interval), therefore placing the beginning of the sulfate reduction zone and the production of \chem{H_2S} to the deeper sediments \citep{reimers_porewater_1996}. 
Iron processes are currently not dynamically represented in OMEN-SED. 
In addition, produced dissolved \chem{Fe} reacts with \chem{H_2S} to form iron sulfides (e.g. pyrite, \chem{FeS_2}) and thus further inhibits the rise of \chem{H_2S} \citep{reimers_seasonal_1990}. 
The iron cycle also plays a critical role for phosphorus, as the reduction of iron(III) hydroxides in the surface sediments releases sorbed phosphate, leading to pore waters around and below 2 cm which are supersaturated with 
respect to fluorapatite, thus initiating \chem{CFA} precipitation. \citet{reimers_porewater_1996} could even show that the accumulation of \chem{CFA} is mainly restricted to the near-surface sediments ($\sim 5$ cm) 
instead of throughout the sediment column. % throughout the sediment column: Ruttenberg and Berner, 1993
As OMEN-SED currently does not include an iron-cyle, and Fe-bound P and \chem{CFA} processes are highly parameterised, the model is not able to capture these complex, non-steady state phosphorus 
dynamics at this specific site. 
For the Nazar\'e Canyon station (4298 m) satisfactory fits could be realised apart from \chem{NH_4}. However, also \citet{epping_oxidation_2002} could not obtain a better fit 
using a more complex diagenetic model. They suggested non-local solute exchange resulting from bioirrigation being responsible for the higher \chem{NH_4} concentrations at this site which is neglected in their model, as well as in 
OMEN-SED. Furthermore, the fractured POC profile (indicating episodic depositional events through the canyon) could have been approximated using a different partitioning of the bulk POC into 
labile and refractory pool with different degradation rate constants, thus potentially leading to a better fit of the \chem{NH_4} profile.  
In general, better approximations of the data could have potentially been acquired by applying a sensitivity study using different NC-ratios \citep[e.g.][report different ratios from Redfield stoichiometry]{epping_oxidation_2002} 
and exploring the parameter space for the secondary reaction parameters ($\gamma_{NH_4}$, $\gamma_{H_2S}$). 
However, considering these generalisations and our assumption of steady-state, which might not be valid, particularly for the complex Santa Barbara basin, the shallow core and the Nazar\'e Canyon, which are affected by seasonality 
and biology, OMEN-SED generally reproduces the observed pore water trends and hence captures the main diagenetic processes.

\subsection{Case study: Stand-alone simulations of global ocean transect}\label{subsec:globalhypsometry}
\subsubsection{Methodology}
In this section we explore to what degree OMEN-SED is capable of capturing the dynamics of organic matter degradation pathways and related TEA-fluxes as simulated with a more complete and complex numerical diagenetic model \citep{thullner_global_scale_2009}. 
Therefore, we reproduce the simulations of typical conditions along a global ocean hypsometry of \citet{thullner_global_scale_2009} and compare our modelled TEA-fluxes with the results of the complex model as well as with 
observations from \citet{middelburg_denitrification_1996}. To explore the global degradation of OM in the seafloor 
\citet{thullner_global_scale_2009} quantified various diagenetic processes using the Biogeochemical Reaction Network Simulator \citep[BRNS,][]{aguilera_knowledge-based_2005}, 
a flexible simulation environment suitable for reactive transport simulations of complex biogeochemical problems \citep[e.g.][]{jourabchi_quantitative_2005, thullner_modeling_2005}. 
\citet{thullner_global_scale_2009} used seafloor depth (SFD) as the master variable and calculated model parameters, such as $w$, $D_{bio}$ and $\phi$, from existing empirical relationships 
\citep[e.g.][]{van1995metal, middelburg_empirical_1997}. 
Organic matter degradation was described with a 1G approach, thus assuming a single pool of organic matter of uniform reactivity. 
The first order rate constant was related to the burial velocity, $w$ (cm year$^{-1}$), following the empirical relationship of \citet{boudreau1997diagenetic}:
\begin{align}
 k=0.38\cdot w^{0.59}.
\end{align}
This rate constant can be assumed as the mean reactivity of the organic matter fractions which are degraded in the upper, bioturbated $10-20$ cm of the sediments. 
Thus, more reactive fractions (degraded during days/weeks close to the SWI) and more refractory fractions (degraded on longer time scales deeper in the sediments) are not captured by this relationship \citep{boudreau1997diagenetic}. 
BRNS simulations were performed using boundary conditions and parameters for depths representative for shelf, slope and deep sea sediments (i.e. SFD of 100m, 200m, 500m, 1000m, 2000m, 3500m and 5000m). 
In order to reproduce these results, OMEN-SED is configured here as a 1G model and boundary conditions and model parameters are defined as in \citet[][see Table \ref{table:Hypsometry_params}]{thullner_global_scale_2009}. 
As OMEN-SED assumes a fixed fraction (i.e. $\gamma_{NH_4}$, $\gamma_{H_2S}$) of reduced substances to be reoxidised, which exerts a large impact on the resulting SWI-fluxes (compare Section \ref{subsec:SA}), 
two sets of simulations are performed in order to show the range of possible model outputs. In the first setup 95\% of the reduced substances are reoxidised (i.e. $\gamma_{NH_4}=\gamma_{H_2S}=0.95$) and in the 
second, less realistic case, only 5\% are reoxidised (all other model parameters and boundary conditions are equal).  \textbf{why not 0 and 1 to show the entire range??}

\subsubsection{Results}
%\subsection{Stand-alone simulations of global ocean transect}\label{subsec:globalhypsometry}
%Figure \ref{fig:hypsometry} (A-C) compares simulated depth-integrated organic matter mineralisation rates ($\mu$mol C cm$^{-2}$\,yr$^{-1}$) by three degradation pathways along the global hypsometry. 
Figure \ref{fig:hypsometry} compares simulated SWI-fluxes of TEAs (i.e. \chem{O_2}, \chem{NO_3} and \chem{SO_4}) along the global hypsometry using OMEN-SED (black lines) with the results of \citet{thullner_global_scale_2009} 
(red lines). 
Observations for \chem{O_2} and \chem{NO_3} fluxes are taken from \citet{middelburg_denitrification_1996}. 
% Also plotted in Fig. \ref{fig:hypsometry}A are the total oxygen uptake (TOU) estimates presented in \citet{thullner_global_scale_2009} (filled red symbols), who assumed the organic matter flux to be equivalent to TOU. 
Due to the applied empirical relations organic matter flux to the seafloor decreases by 2 orders of magnitude from 100 to 5000 m and its degradation rate constant by 1 order of magnitude (Table \ref{table:Hypsometry_params}). 
Therefore, the rate of organic matter degradation is about 50 times greater at 100 m than at 5000 m \citep[compare][]{thullner_global_scale_2009}, thus resulting in a decrease of TEA-fluxes along the 
hypsometry (Figure \ref{fig:hypsometry}). 
% actual OMEN values are weird: Therefore, the rate of organic matter degradation is about 15 times greater at 100 m (2765 $\mu$mol cm$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$) than at 5000 m (175 $\mu$mol cm$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$), thus resulting in a decrease of TEA-fluxes along the hypsometry (Figure \ref{fig:hypsometry}). 
The 95\%-reoxidation experiments (dots) show proportionally higher \chem{O_2} in-fluxes than the the 5\%-reoxidation experiments (triangles) because more \chem{O_2} is utilised for 
in situ production of \chem{NO_3} and \chem{SO_4} in the sediments. This is also mirrored by the increased \chem{NO_3} out-flux and decreased \chem{SO_4} in-flux for shallower SFDs. 
This is in line with the results of \citet{thullner_global_scale_2009} which showed that in situ production is an important pathway of \chem{SO_4} supply in the sediment, which is responsible for $\sim$80\% of the total OM degradation at depths 
between 100 and 2000 m (in our results \chem{SO_4} is not used for OM degradation in OMEN-SED below 2000m).
In general, Figure \ref{fig:hypsometry} shows that OMEN-SED captures the main trends in observed and numerically simulated TEA fluxes well. Results also confirm that higher $\gamma$-values better represent SWI-fluxes for most of the global hypsometry. 
A slight overestimation of shallow ocean SWI-fluxes (SFD < 200\,m) for the high $\gamma$ scenario indicates that slightly lower $\gamma$-values would better capture SWI-fluxes in these areas, where rapid oxygen consumption favours the 
escape of reduced species across the SWI.
% where intense oxygen consumption processes and, thus rapid oxygen consumption favours the escape of reduced species across the SWI.

\end{figure}

In addition, observed \chem{O_2} fluxes in the upper 2000m are generally encompassed by our total range in predicted OMEN-SED fluxes. Oxygen fluxes for the deep-sea sediments, however, are slightly underestimated. 
These deviations can presumably be related to the assumed 1G description of organic matter degradation, which neglects the more labile OM pool. This highly reactive pool is degraded close to the sediment surface, 
thus promoting higher aerobic degradation rates and higher \chem{O_2} fluxes.  
Nitrate fluxes in the upper 500m of the Atlantic Ocean are well predicted. However, as in \citet{middelburg_denitrification_1996} the direction of calculated nitrate fluxes in the upper 1000m of the Pacific Ocean differ from the observations. 
\citet{middelburg_denitrification_1996} related these discrepancies to the globally averaged model parameters and the applied boundary conditions. They could reduce the disagreements significantly by using more representative 
bottom water concentrations for the eastern Pacific and a higher flux of labile organic matter for their 2G model. By changing the boundary conditions and the N:C elemental ratio of organic matter for the whole hypsometry, it is possible 
to obtain a better model-data fit with OMEN-SED for the shallow Pacific Ocean (green line in Fig. \ref{fig:hypsometry}B). 
\citet{bohlen_simple_2012} report that the elemental N:C ratio strongly deviates from Redfield stoichiometry (0.151) with specifically lower values for the East Pacific Ocean. The use of their globally averaged value of 0.067 allows 
reconciling modelled and observed values provided that bottom water conditions are also changed to the low oxygen/high nitrate levels more likely to be found in the shallow Pacific Ocean 
($\chem{O_2} = 10$ nmol cm$^{-3}$ and $\chem{NO_3} = 80$ nmol cm$^{-3}$). 


\section{Coupled pre-industrial Earth system model simulations}\label{sec:ESM_coupling}
\subsection{Coupling to the cGENIE Earth system model}\label{subsubsec:Methods_ESM_coupling}
% Describe what needs to be done/checked. Compare/use as example what I did with GENIE coupling. What are the if-clauses used? Input to OMEN-SED, output of OMEN-SED. 
\begin{figure}[tbp]

	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/OMEN-GENIE-coupling_GRID.pdf}
	\caption{Schematic of the relationship between OMEN-SED and cGENIE. Arrows represent the information transferred between models. }
	\label{fig:OMEN-GENIE-coupling}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
In a final step, we couple OMEN-SED to the carbon-centric version of the ``GENIE'' Earth system model \citep[cGENIE,][]{ridgwell_marine_2007} in order to illustrate how a fully coupled ocean-sediment system can be 
configure and applied. We start by providing a brief description of cGENIE and the coupling procedure (Fig. \ref{fig:OMEN-GENIE-coupling}). 

cGENIE is a model of Intermediate Complexity based on the efficient climate model ``C-GOLDSTEIN''  of \citet{edwards_uncertainties_2005}, featuring a frictional-geostrophic 3D-ocean circulation model coupled to a fast 
Energy-Moisture Balance 2D-atmosphere together with a dynamic-thermodynamic sea-ice component. 
The version of cGENIE used here includes the marine geochemical cycling of carbon, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur \citep{ridgwell_marine_2007}, 
preservation of carbonates in deep-sea sediments \citep[SEDGEM,][]{ridgwell_regulation_2007} and terrestrial weathering \citep{colbourn_rock_2013}. 
The ocean model is implemented on a 36$\times$36 equal-area horizontal grid with 16 vertical levels using the pre-industrial continental configuration and bathymetry as in \citet{archer_atmospheric_2009}. 
A finer grid (72$\times$72) is used for the sediments \citep[see Fig. \ref{fig:TOC_Obs_regridded}C and ][]{ridgwell_regulation_2007} and OMEN-SED is called by SEDGEM for each wet ocean grid point. 
%In contrast to \citet{archer_atmospheric_2009} the same grid resolution (36$\times$36) is used for the sediment geochemistry model SEDGEM. 
Depending on the configuration of the overlying biogeochemical ocean model, processes can be included or excluded in OMEN-SED and stoichiometric factors (Tab. \ref{table:reaction_parameters}) need to be matched between models 
to ensure preservation of mass. As nitrogen is not modelled explicitly in the employed cGENIE configuration, \chem{NC_i}, $\chem{ALK}^\mathrm{NIT}$ and $\chem{ALK}^\mathrm{DEN}$ in OMEN-SED are set to zero. 
cGENIE, however, implicitly includes the effects of \chem{NH_4} release and its complete nitrification on alkalinity but neglects the impact of P release. Therefore, alkalinity 
stoichiometries for aerobic degradation, sulfate reduction and methanogenesis are changed to $\chem{ALK}^\mathrm{OX} = -16/106$, $\chem{ALK}^\mathrm{SUL} = 122/106$ and $\chem{ALK}^\mathrm{MET} = -16/106$, respectively 
(compare to default in Table \ref{table:reaction_parameters}).

Various biogeochemical tracers and parameters are transferred from SEDGEM to OMEN-SED (see Fig. \ref{fig:OMEN-GENIE-coupling}) and are converted into the required units. 
Bottom water concentrations of solutes are converted from mol\,kg$^{-1}$ to mol\,cm$^{-3}$ and the depositional flux of POC (\chem{POC_{flux}}) is converted from cm$^{3}$\,cm$^{-2}$\,yr$^{-1}$ 
to mol\,cm$^{-2}$\,yr$^{-1}$ assuming an average density of POC of 1.0\,cm$^{3}$\,g$^{-1}$. 
Within the water column in cGENIE, POC is partitioned into two fractions with different degradation length scales of  $\sim$590\,m and 1000000\,m, respectively. The labile pool thus degrades while sinking through the water column, 
whereas the refractory pool is assumed relatively unreactive \citep{ridgwell_marine_2007}. Thus, depending on seafloor depth, the partitioning of bulk POC reaching the sediments is different 
(Fig. \ref{fig:OM_reactivity}A+B). This information is used by OMEN-SED to define the parameters $f_1$ and $f_2$. 
Other parameters used from cGENIE are seafloor depth and local temperature. 
%For bottom water oxygen concentrations below 5 $\mu$mol kg$^{-1}$ the bioturbation depth is changed from 10 to 0.01 cm to account for the reduced presence of organisms under anoxia.  
The advection/burial rate ($w$) is taken from the previous time-step of cGENIE, however, it is assured that $w$ is not smaller than the detrital flux (\chem{Det_{flux}})
to the sediments (e.g. $w<0$ can occur if initially carbonate rich sediments are eroded during the spin-up of cGENIE). In case ($w \leq \chem{Det_{flux}}$ \& $\chem{Det_{flux}} = 0.0$) all POC is remineralised 
at the ocean floor. Furthermore, a minimum value of $w=0.4$\,cm\,kyr$^{-1}$ is imposed as OMEN-SED tends to be less stable for lower values. %\textbf{how does that compare with w observations?? and the Burwiecz data set??} 
For comparison, this threshold is crossed for seafloor depths below 7000\,m when applying the relationship between burial rate and water depth of \citet{middelburg_empirical_1997} and below 5200\,m for the \citet{burwicz_estimation_2011} 
parameterisation. The bulk \chem{POC_{flux}} is seperated into the labile and refractory component and the routine to find the steady-state solution for POC is called. 
Here, the two POC depositional fluxes are first converted into SWI concentrations ($\chem{POC}_i(z=0)$, in mol\,cm$^{-3}$) by solving the flux divergence equation: 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial F}{\partial z}=-\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\left( -\xi D_i \frac{\partial \chem{POC}_i}{\partial z} +\xi w \chem{POC}_i\right) \label{Eq_flux_divergence}
\end{equation}
for z=0. 
OMEN-SED then computes the fraction of POC preserved in the sediment ($f_{\mathrm{POC}}$, see Eq. (\ref{f_POC_pres})) and subsequently calls the routines to find the steady-state 
solutions for the solute substances. Note, that in this initial coupling the calculated benthic uptake/return fluxes $F_{C_i}$ of dissolved species $C_i$ (compare Eq. (\ref{Eq:F_Ci_SWIflux})) are 
adjusted for the advective loss at the lower sediment boundary ($w \cdot C_i(z_\infty)$) to assure the conservation of mass in the coupled model:
\begin{equation}
 F_{C_i} = \phi(0) \left(D_i \frac{\partial C_i(z)}{\partial z}\bigg\rvert_{z=0} - w \left[ C_i(0) - C_i(z_\infty) \right]\right).
\end{equation}
In case OMEN-SED computes unrealistic results for POC preservation (i.e. $f_{\mathrm{POC}} < 0.0$ or $f_{\mathrm{POC}} > 1.0$) we discard the results of OMEN-SED and all POC is remineralised at the ocean floor. 
For the modern ocean setup, using the adjustments for $w$ described above, this has not occured and is just installed as a safety check. 
Finally, \chem{f_{\mathrm{POC}}} and the SWI-fluxes of solutes ($F_{C_i}$, in mol\,cm$^{-2}$\,yr$^{-1}$) are returned to cGENIE. 
In case no POC is deposited on the seafloor (i.e. $\chem{POC_{flux}}=0$), OMEN-SED is not executed and \chem{f_{\mathrm{POC}}} and $F_{C_i}$ for all $i$ are set to zero. 
In order to reduce memory requirements, the sediment profiles (e.g. as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:Sediment_profiles}) are not calculated in the FORTRAN version of OMEN-SED, 
however, the boundary conditions are saved and sediment profiles for specific grid-cells, ocean basins and ocean transects can be plotted at the end of each experiment 
using the stand-alone MATLAB version of OMEN-SED.

As shown in our sensitivity analysis (Section \ref{subsec:SA}) and discussed by \citet{arndt_quantifying_2013}, the 
degradation rate constants for OM ($k_i$) are the most influential parameters and exert a dominant control on the SWI-flux of redox-sensitive elements as well as the preservation of organic matter. 
Yet, their spatial variability is unknown at the global scale and reported rate constants in the sediments can vary by about 10 orders of magnitude or more \citep{middelburg_organic_1993, arndt_quantifying_2013}. 
Furthermore, when OMEN-SED is coupled to cGENIE, very different timescales have to be considered for OM degradation in the sediments compared to the water column (Fig. \ref{fig:OM_reactivity}A+B) and thus the diagenetic rate constants cannot 
be easily implied by the assumed water column POC flux profiles in cGENIE. To illustrate this, lets consider the degradation of fresh, marine organic matter as it is transported and degraded along the ocean-sediment continuum. 
The bulk material is composed of a complex mixture of different organic carbon compounds that can be described by a reactivity continuum. Microbes preferentially degrade the more reactive organic matter compounds 
first \citep{emerson_processes_1988, wakeham_compositions_1997, lee_composition_2000}, resulting in the preferential preservation of more unreactive compounds, rendering the remaining mixture less and less reactive with time. 
Thus depending on the age of OM (or depth in the water and sediment column) the reactivity distribution of its compounds changes significantly (Fig. \ref{fig:OM_reactivity}C) and the multi-G (2G in this case) approximation of this continuum 
has to take this shift into account. Fig. \ref{fig:OM_reactivity} illustrates these changes in the original reactivity distribution within a ocean-sediment framework. The reactivity distribution $t<1$ year represents the organic matter mixture 
after it settled through the water column (Fig. \ref{fig:OM_reactivity}C). Only the most reactive OM compounds are remineralised. This explains why the POC flux in the ocean can be represented with a 1G or pseudo 2G degradation model. 
In the sediments, however, much longer timescales have to be considered and a wider range of more unreactive compounds are degraded. As a consequence, significant changes in the reactivity distribution already take place in the upper millimetres of the 
sediments ($t \sim 10$ years, Fig. \ref{fig:OM_reactivity}C). Therefore, a broader range of OM reactive types must be represented by the degradation model to capture the reactivity spectrum of OM in surface sediments, explaining why at least a 
pseudo 3G model  \citep[including two degradable and one refractory fraction][]{soetaert_model_1996, boudreau1997diagenetic, stolpovsky_toward_2015} is required. 
To complicate the situation even further, different sediment depths can represent very different timescales. For instance, half a meter of sediment can be deposited within a year in a coastal setting, while it will represent thousands of years 
(if not more) of sedimentation in a deep ocean setting. Therefore, residence times and thus degradation rate timescales (or OM age) are mainly controlled by advection rates. For instance, assuming an advection rate of 0.01 cm/yr for the shallow ocean, OM 
at 5cm depth is has been degraded for approximately 500 years, whereas a deep ocean advection rate of 0.001 cm/year allowed for OM degradation of approximately 1000 years at the same depth. As a consequence, organic matter degradation in deep 
ocean sediments affects a much wider range of the reactivity continuum and our simple pseudo 3G approximation of the complex OM mixture needs to reflect this by allowing for different k and f values (Fig. \ref{fig:OM_reactivity}C).  

Thus defining appropriate OM degradation rate constants is a major challenge and source of uncertainty for diagenetic models. The rate constants in models are either determined through profile fitting for a specific site or, 
for global applications, they are related to a single, readily available characteristic (or master variable) of the local environmental conditions. 
For instance, considerable effort has been expended to relate the apparent rate constant for oxic and 
anoxic OM degradation to sedimentation rate ($w$) and various empirical relations have been proposed \citep{toth_organic_1977, tromp_global_1995, boudreau1997diagenetic, stolpovsky_toward_2015}. 
Nevertheless, these relationships are generally based and/or tested on limited data sets and their global applicability, especially under past or projected future environmental conditions is questionable \citep{arndt_quantifying_2013}. 
We hence test several alternative schemes in the coupled OMEN-cGENIE framework. 
Our objective is not to perform and discuss a detailed calibration of the coupled models as this is beyond the scope of this sediment model development paper. 
Rather we want to showcase the feasibility of the model coupling, illustrate the range of results and thus information that can be generated with OMEN-SED and verify that model results capture the main observed global benthic biogeochemical features. 

\subsubsection{Methodology}
In this section we compare modelled mean POC weight percentages (wt\%) in the upper 5cm of the sediments  (\chem{POC_{5cm}}) to the global distribution pattern of POC content in surface sediments 
(< 5cm sediment depth) of \citet{seiter_organic_2004} using different parameterisations for the degradation rate constants $k_1$ and $k_2$. 
For our observational target we take the original POC distribution pattern in $1^\circ \times 1^\circ$ grid resolution \citep[interpolated from > 5500 measurements, compare][]{seiter_organic_2004} and transform it onto the $72\times 72$ SEDGEM grid 
(Figure \ref{fig:TOC_Obs_regridded}). The regridding of the original POC distribution obviously affects the resolution of the data, especially for the continental margin, as some sites with higher POC wt\% are lost in the 
regridding process (compare e.g. maximum values for the East Pacific and upwelling waters of the Namibian shelf, Figure \ref{fig:TOC_Obs_regridded}A + B). 
The colour of the points in Figures \ref{fig:OMEN_GENIE_invariant_results} - \ref{fig:OMEN_GENIE_Boudreau_depth} %, which compare modelled and observed POC concentrations, 
indicates the seafloor depth (SFD) of the respective cGENIE grid-cell. 
As the individual data-points are highly scattered and 
in order to see if a certain relation between $k_1$ and $k_2$ performs better for specific ocean depths, the data-points are binned into 6 uniform depth-classes of 1000m each (respective mean POC wt\% and SFD are represented by 
the triangles). The regression line (and the corresponding R$^2$-value) is calculated for the 6 bin-classes and included in the figures.

\textcolor{red}{TODO Andy: Section describing the prescribed fields of solids (i.e. detrital, opal, \chem{CaCO_3}) to the sediments!}

To parameterise the reactivity of organic matter in OMEN-SED two different schemes are tested and compared. First, spatially uniform degradation rate constants $k_1$ and $k_2$ are assumed. 
By simulating two different pools of POC in the water-column characterised by different degradation length scales \citep{ridgwell_marine_2007}, cGENIE implicitly accounts for the decrease in mean POC reactivity with water-depth. 
The rate constants for the more refractory OM pool, $k_2$, is systematically varied between 0.004 and 0.006 year$^{-1}$ and the more labile OM component, described by $k_1$, is assumed to degrade a multiple times faster 
(i.e. $x \in \{1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.5, 2\}$ ). 
However, although accounting for the decrease in mean POC reactivity with seafloor depth, this approach does not take into account the change in distribution of organic matter reactivity types caused by different burial velocities 
and thus different residence time scales in the sediments (Fig. \ref{fig:OM_reactivity}). Therefore, the second approach uses the empirical relationship proposed by \citet{boudreau1997diagenetic}, 
which relates the apparent OM degradation rate constant in the upper sediments to the burial velocity, $w$ (cm year$^{-1}$, see also Section \ref{subsec:globalhypsometry}):
\begin{equation}
 k_\mathrm{app} = 0.38 \cdot w^{0.59}.
\end{equation}
Following \citet{boudreau1997diagenetic} and \citet{stolpovsky_toward_2015} it can be assumed that $k_\mathrm{app}$ represents the mean OM reactivity within the upper 10-20cm of the sediments. 
The following assumptions are made in order to calculate the two degradation rate constants for OMEN-SED:
\begin{align}
  k_\mathrm{app} &= f_1 \cdot k_1 + f_2 \cdot k_2 \label{boudreau_assumption1}\\
  k_1 &= x \cdot k_2					\label{boudreau_assumption2}
\end{align}
where $x$ describes the relation between $k_1$ and $k_2$ and is subject to sensitivity experiments (with values of $x \in \{2, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25\}$). 
Note that the differences between  $k_1$ and $k_2$ using this approach is significantly larger as in the globally uniform approach. 
As the fractions of labile and refractory OM reaching the sediments ($f_1, f_2$) is known from cGENIE, $k_1$ and $k_2$ can be calculated independently for each grid-cell. 

To simulate steady state sediment composition we configure the model as a ``closed'' system, i.e., one in which there is no loss of \chem{CaCO_3} through burial. The redox dependent P-cycle in OMEN-SED is not used in these experiments and 
all organic phosphorus is returned at the seafloor. To speed up the calculation and to assure that ocean redox changes caused by OMEN-SED do not impact the sediment composition of \chem{CaCO_3}, we use the prescribed solid fields as described earlier. 
Apart from the prescribed fields and the $72\times 72$ sediment grid the model is configured as in \citet{archer_atmospheric_2009} and atmospheric \chem{CO_2} is restored to a pre-industrial value of 278 ppmv. 
First a 20,000 year spinup is performed without OMEN-SED being coupled. All presented coupled cGENIE-OMEN simulations are run for 10,000 years to steady state from this spinup. 
OMEN-SED is called for each grid-cell in every time step, feeding back the resulting SWI-fluxes and the fraction of POC preserved in the sediments to cGENIE.

\end{figure}
% However, imposing the depth dependent relation of the degradation rate constants is rather arbitrary and the POC wt\% data used for the comparison has their own limitations (compare Section\ref{subsec:Parameterising_OM_rate_const}). 
% In addition, the empirical relationship used \citep{boudreau1997diagenetic} and the regression model obtained is based on modern day observations and very likely not valid under different environmental conditions during Earth 
% history \citep[e.g.][]{hulse_understanding_2017}.
%First, the degradation rate constants are parameterised on model intrinsic information only using the spatially uniform approach. By providing two pools of POC from the water-column characterised by different degradation rate constants, cGENIE accounts 
%for the decrease in bulk POC degradability with water-depth. 
%Therefore, the imposed depth dependent relation of the degradation rate constants presented in Figure \ref{fig:OMEN_GENIE_Boudreau_results} could also be regarded as double-accounting. 
Figure \ref{fig:OMEN_GENIE_invariant_results} presents results for the spatially uniform degradation rate experiments. 
%, where $k_2$ is systematically varied between 0.004 and 0.006 year$^{-1}$ and the more labile OM component, $k_1$, is assumed to degrade $x \in \{2, 3, 4, 5, 10\}$ times faster, respectively. 
In general, using spatially uniform degradation rate constants 5 of the 6 bin-classes are located closer to the 1:1 line as in the experiments using the \citet{boudreau1997diagenetic} relation (Fig. \ref{fig:OMEN_GENIE_Boudreau_results}). 
Also the slope of some regression lines is close to 1.0 (e.g. $(k_2, x) \in \{ (0.004, 1.5),  (0.0045, 1.3), (0.005, 1.2), (0.005, 1.3), (0.0055, 1.1), (0.0055, 1.2), (0.006, 1.1)\}$), indicating that the simpler parameterisation adequately 
captures the relationship between between depth and observed POC wt\% by bin-class. The reason for this is that BIOGEM provides a depth dependent POC flux and partitioning between the two fractions (Fig. \ref{fig:OM_reactivity}). 
The shallowest bin-class (between 0 and 1000m) represents an exception, as OMEN-SED tends to overestimate POC preservation for this depth class. However, this could also be related to the regridding of the original POC distribution 
pattern of \citep{seiter_organic_2004} on to the SEDGEM grid, as some data grid-cells with higher POC wt\% on the continental margin are lost due to the restricted SEDGEM resolution (compare Section \ref{subsec:Parameterising_OM_rate_const}). 
Overall, using this parameterisation, a relationship where the labile POC fraction degrades not more than 1.5 times faster than the refractory fraction fits the 
\citet{seiter_organic_2004} data better than a larger spread between both POC pools (i.e. $x > 2.0$). 
We discuss later the implications of collapsing the $k$ values in this specific calibration for long-term, geological carbon preservation. 
% \textcolor{red}{Say something about, that this can potentially be explained as the observations represent OM concentrations in the upper 5cm of the sediments where the range of reactivities to be considered is smaller than

\end{figure}


Next the relationship of \citet{boudreau1997diagenetic} and the assumptions of Eq. (\ref{boudreau_assumption1}) and (\ref{boudreau_assumption2}) are used to calculate $k_1$ 
and $k_2$. In Figure \ref{fig:OMEN_GENIE_Boudreau_results} (A-H) the relation between the two degradation rate constants (Eq. (\ref{boudreau_assumption2})) is changed globally, thus independent of the seafloor depth. 
The crossplots show that it is not possible to achieve a solution where all bin-classes fall onto, or close to, the 1:1 line. Also, the slope of the regression lines are generally much larger or smaller than 1.0 
(with the exception of Figure \ref{fig:OMEN_GENIE_Boudreau_results}C), indicating that the relationship between depth and observed POC wt\% by bin-class is not adequately represented by the model. 
The R$^2$ values are strictly monotonically increasing for increasing $x$ because a depth-dependency is artificially imposed for the modelled POC wt\% through the relation between $k_1$ and $k_2$. 
When looking at the individual bin-classes it can be seen that shallow ocean depths are better represented by smaller differences between $k_1$ and $k_2$ (e.g. $k_1 = 5 \cdot k_2$ for SFD < 1000m, Figure \ref{fig:OMEN_GENIE_Boudreau_results}B),
and the deep ocean by a larger spread (e.g. $k_1 = 25 \cdot k_2$ for SFD > 3000m, Figure \ref{fig:OMEN_GENIE_Boudreau_results}H). 
These results reflect the preferential degradation of more reactive organic matter types \citep{wakeham_compositions_1997, lee_composition_2000} and thus the change in the distribution functions of OM reactive types for different OM ages (Fig. \ref{fig:OM_reactivity}C). 
In the shallow ocean bulk POC consists of fresher organic matter types on average and is therefore generally more reactive overall (i.e. higher $k_\mathrm{app}$ due to higher $w$ in the model) as in the deep ocean. In addition, OM at 5cm sediment depth in 
the deep ocean is generally older as in the shallow ocean due to lower burial rates, therefore more reactive types are affected by degradation and a larger spread between k-values is needed to capture these dynamics (compare Fig. \ref{fig:OM_reactivity}C). 
% In a greatly simplified way, this can be interpreted as bulk POC in the shallow ocean being more reactive (i.e. higher $k_\mathrm{app}$) and consisting of fresher organic matter types, therefore the degradation rate constants of the 
% two pools are more similar (i.e. $k_2 < k_1$). In the deeper ocean, bulk POC is generally less reactive (i.e. lower $k_\mathrm{app}$) and due to the preferential degradation of more reactive organic matter types in the water-column 
% \citep{wakeham_compositions_1997, lee_composition_2000} the refractory POC pool can be considered as being several orders of magnitude less reactive compared to the labile POC pool (i.e. $k_2 \ll k_1$).

\end{figure}

Departing from our theoretical considerations (see discussion of Fig. \ref{fig:OM_reactivity}C), we use these observations to create a depth dependent relationship between the two degradation rate constants, where $x$ in Eq. (\ref{boudreau_assumption2}) is a function of SFD and takes values of $x=5$ for SFD < 1000m, $x=8$ for 1000m $\leq$ SFD < 2000m, 
$x=12$ for 2000m $\leq$ SFD < 3000m and $x=25$ for SFD $\geq$ 3000m for the 6 SFD bin-classes, respectively. 
In this depth dependent approach all bin-classes are close to the 1:1 line and the resulting regression model accounts for 92.6\% of the variance of the modeled POC wt\% around the observed mean of the bin-classes (Figure \ref{fig:OMEN_GENIE_Boudreau_depth}A). 
Furthermore, the slope of the regression line (0.9662) indicates that the relationship between depth and observed POC wt\% for the bin-classes is well represented by the model. 
The histograms (Fig. \ref{fig:OMEN_GENIE_Boudreau_depth}C+D) visualize the difference between modelled and observed mean POC concentrations and demonstrate the high density of data points close to the 1:1 line. 
% meeting the assumptions of a normal distribution
For the depth dependent approach, 92.5\% of the cGENIE grid-cells show a difference between modelled and observed POC concentration of less than 1.0 POC wt\%; in 79.9\% of the grid-cells, the difference is less than 0.5 POC wt\% 
(for the globally uniform approach the percentages are 95.37\% and 70.95\%, respectively). 

Both experiments reproduce minimal POC concentrations in the subtropical gyres and generally higher concentrations along the continental margins (Fig. \ref{fig:OMEN_GENIE_Boudreau_depth}E+F). 
Both experiments, however, underestimate mean POC wt\% in the surface sediments of the equatorial east Pacific and overestimate POC concentrations 
in the North Pacific and Southern Oceans (Fig. \ref{fig:OMEN_GENIE_Boudreau_depth}G+H). 
The depth dependent approach of \citet{boudreau1997diagenetic} shows more spatial variability in POC preservation than the other parameterisation. 
In general, implementing lower, anaerobic degradation rate constants when bottom water oxygen concentrations fall below a threshold value could potentially improve the simulation of higher POC concentrations in areas with high POC input to the 
sediments \citep{palastanga_long_term_2011}.

%\textbf{why not plot the O2 observations from the global hypsometry figure and/or stopolsky as dots on the map?? Or you could also show the Seiter ODU map for oxic degradation rates. I also have seen globals maps of O2 consumption- will try to digg this out. Should be quickly done as all the data is compiled.} 

For the spatially uniform experiment A ($(k_2, x) = (0.005, 1.3)$) modelled SWI-fluxes and sediment characteristics are shown in Figure \ref{fig:OMEN_GENIE_best_fit_invariant}.
Modelled total POC degradation (\chem{POC_{degr}}) rates in the upper sediments decrease from the shelves to the deep sea by up to 2 orders of magnitude (Fig. \ref{fig:OMEN_GENIE_best_fit_invariant}B). 
This is in agreement with data from the literature \citep[e.g.][]{middelburg_organic_1993, middelburg_empirical_1997, burdige_preservation_2007} 
and other model results \citep[e.g.][]{thullner_global_scale_2009} which indicate that the highest degradation rates in marine sediments are found in the coastal ocean (SFD < 200\,m). 
Oxygen fluxes into the sediments (Fig. \ref{fig:OMEN_GENIE_best_fit_invariant}C) range from 0.0 for the deep ocean and sites without OM deposition to values of about 300\,$\mu$mol cm$^{-2}$yr$^{-1}$ for the shallow ocean with the highest POC degradation rates. 
Influx of \chem{SO_4}  into the sediments is rather low (between 0.0 and 23.9 $\mu$mol cm$^{-2}$yr$^{-1}$) because in OMEN-SED 95\% of produced \chem{H_2S} is reoxidised to \chem{SO_4}, therefore sulfate reduction is mainly driven by in situ sulfide oxidation. 
However, in general the coupled model fluxes fall well within the ranges predicted by the stand-alone global hypsometry experiments (\chem{O_2} between 0.0 and 800\,$\mu$mol cm$^{-2}$yr$^{-1}$ and \chem{SO_4} between 0.0 and about 300 $\mu$mol cm$^{-2}$yr$^{-1}$, 
compare Section \ref{subsec:globalhypsometry}). 
In accordance with the total POC degradation rates the release of \chem{PO_4} shows a maximum value of 8.12\,nmol cm$^{-2}$yr$^{-1}$ on the shelves (Fig. \ref{fig:OMEN_GENIE_best_fit_invariant}D). 
The relative contribution of aerobic POC degradation in the upper sediments increases from the shelves to the deep sea (Fig. \ref{fig:OMEN_GENIE_best_fit_invariant}G) 
which is also consistent with estimates from %the literature \citep[e.g.][]{middelburg_empirical_1997} as well as other model results. 
\citet{thullner_global_scale_2009} who found that oxygen is responsible for less than 10\% of \chem{POC_{degr}} at 100\,m SFD and for more 
than 80\% in the deep sea. 
The oxygen penetration depth in OMEN-SED increases from values below 1cm at the shelves to more than 10cm in the deep ocean (Fig. \ref{fig:OMEN_GENIE_best_fit_invariant}H 
and \ref{fig:OMEN_GENIE_Boudreau_depthdep_zox_vs_SFD}).
Small oxygen penetration depths of a few millimetres are typical for bioturbated sediments in the coastal ocean \citep[e.g.][]{wenzhofer_benthic_2002} and 
the oxygen penetration depth has been shown to increase rapidly with SFD to more than 10\,cm in the deep sea \citep{meile_global_2003, glud_oxygen_2008}. 
\citet{fischer_oxygen_2009} and \citet{dhondt_presence_2015} even found cores along a transect in the South Pacific gyre being oxygenated over their entire length (up to 8\,m or even 75\,m, respectively) which is consistent 
with our model results (not shown). Simulated mean oxygen penetration depths for the 6 depth bin-classes also agree well with observations compiled by 
\citet[][Fig. \ref{fig:OMEN_GENIE_Boudreau_depthdep_zox_vs_SFD}]{meile_global_2003}.

\section{Scope of applicability and model limitations}\label{sec:Appl_Limitations}
Because of the high computational cost associated with resolving benthic dynamics, most Earth system Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMICs) and also some of the higher resolution Earth system models either completely neglect 
or merely include a highly simplified representation of benthic-pelagic exchange processes \citep{hulse_understanding_2017}. However, benthic-pelagic coupling plays an important role for carbon cycling and the lack of its representation 
in EMICs compromises our ability to assess the response and recovery of the Earth system to major past, present and future carbon cycle and climate perturbations. As a consequence, there is a need for benthic biogeochemical models that are 
able to capture the main features of benthic biogeochemical dynamics, but that are, at the same time, computationally efficient enough to allow for a direct, dynamic coupling to ocean biogeochemical model. 
Therefore, we have developed OMEN-SED, a, one-dimensional analytical early diagenetic model that offers a predictive ability similar to complex, numerical diagenetic models at a significantly reduced computational cost. 

OMEN-SED is thus not problem-specific. Its reaction network resolves the most pertinent benthic biogeochemical species as well as the most important processes that control their cycling and burial in marine sediments. OMEN-SED can thus be 
coupled to a wide range of regional to global ocean biogeochemical models, as well as EMICs and higher resolution Earth system models to investigate a wide range of research questions associated with past, present or future carbon 
and macro-nutrient cycling. For instance, OMEN-SED can be used to i) quantify benthic macro-nutrient recycling from the shallow coastal to the deep, open ocean, ii) investigate the role of benthic-pelagic coupling in the development of past 
or future ocean anoxia/euxinia, or to iii) estimate global organic carbon burial in marine sediments. In theory, its scope of applicability thus ranges from the regional to the global and from the seasonal to the millennial timescale. 
In order to simulate organic matter preservation in the deeper sediments and thus addressing questions concerning long-term, geological carbon burial the degradation rate constant for the refractory OM pool has to be scaled down. 
The resulting larger difference between degradation rate constants can be interpreted as being needed to capture the broader range of OM reactivities degraded over the entire sediment column (see Fig. \ref{fig:OM_reactivity}). 
Instead, more collapsed degradation rate constants are needed to model OM degradation in the upper sediments, such as the first 5 centimetres as shown in Section \ref{subsubsec:couplingresultscrossplots}.
In addition, the computational efficiency of OMEN-SED allows calculating quantitative sensitivity indices requiring large sample sizes such as variance- or density-based approaches. Therefore, OMEN-SED can also help quantitatively 
investigate sensitivity of benthic model output to systematic variations in model parameters when the model has been tuned to a site-specific problem. 

However, OMEN-SED is inevitably associated with a certain degree of simplifications that may compromise the applicability of the model in its current version under certain circumstances. 
First, we have assumed steady state conditions to allow for an analytical solution of the coupled diagenetic equations. This steady-state assumption is only valid if the variability in boundary conditions and fluxes is generally longer 
than the characteristic timescales of the reaction-transport processes. As a consequence, OMEN-SED is well suited for the coupling to EMICs and the investigation of long-term dynamics in sediment-water exchange fluxes, for instance, 
during past extreme climate events. Yet, in its current version, OMEN-SED is not able to predict the transient response of benthic process rates and fluxes to short-term or seasonal variations of boundary conditions. Yet, future versions of 
OMEN-SED, could approximate non-steady state conditions by incorporating a time-step dependent relaxation between different steady states, similar to the schemes used in \citet{ruardij_benthic_1995} and \citet{arndt_model_2007}. 
Such a pseudo-transient approach would enable the application of OMEN-SED to systems characterised by high-frequency fluctuations in boundary conditions, such as the coastal ocean or estuaries. 

Second, although the model explicitly simulates DIC and alkalinity production and, thus, has the potential to predict pH profiles within the sediment, a major limitation at this stage is the lack of an explicit description for \chem{CaCO_3} 
precipitation/dissolution coupled to OM decomposition, which also controls the inorganic carbon system \citep{krumins_dissolved_2013}. In addition, the current version of OMEN-SED does not yet explicitly resolve iron and manganese dynamics
(although note, that iron is implicitly accounted for in the PO4 equation). This lack currently limits the applicability of OMEN-SED to iron- and manganese rich environments, such as coastal marine environments, upwelling regions or 
ferruginous oceans. In addition, it also compromises the ability of OMEN-SED in predicting \chem{H_2S} fluxes in Fe-rich anoxic environments, where high iron porewater concentrations can deplete porewater \chem{H_2S} by iron-sulfide mineral 
precipitation \citep[e.g.][]{meyers_production_2007}. Therefore, already planned future extensions of OMEN-SED include an explicit description of iron. 

Finally, just as all global models, the global application of OMEN-SED is complicated by the lack of an objective, global framework for biogeochemical process parameterization. The sensitivity study presented here shows that this lack is 
particularly critical for OM degradation rate parameters ($k_i$,$f_i$) and the $\gamma$-values describing the completeness of secondary redox reactions. A comparison between simulated OM contents and observations indicates that depth 
dependent k-f relationships provide the best fit (Section \ref{subsubsec:couplingresultscrossplots}), confirming more theoretical considerations regarding the different time and reactivity scales that need to be considered 
(see Section \ref{subsec:Parameterising_OM_rate_const}). With respect to $\gamma$-values, model simulations along the global hypsometry (Section \ref{subsec:globalhypsometry}) have shown that high $\gamma$-values generally capture 
the main SWI-flux features, but have also highlighted that slightly lower $\gamma$-values would result in a better fit of SWI-fluxes to observations of the shallow ocean. 

\conclusions  %% \conclusions[modified heading if necessary]
Here, we have described in detail and tested OMEN-SED, a new, analytical early diagenetic model resolving organic matter cycling and associated biogeochemical dynamics. OMEN-SED has been explictely designed for the coupling to 
EMICs and combines biogeochemical complexity with computational efficiency. It is the first analytical diagenetic model to explicitly represent oxic degradation, denitrification, sulfate reduction and implicitly methanogenesis, 
as well as the reoxidation of reduced substances, adsorption/desorption, as well as mineral precipitation//dissolution. Explicitly resolved pore water species include \chem{O_2}, \chem{NO_3}, \chem{NH_4}, \chem{SO_4}, \chem{H_2S}, \chem{DIC} 
and \chem{ALK} and the solid phase includes two degradable fractions of organic matter, Fe-bound P and authigenic Ca-P minerals.

An extensive sensitive analysis, based on the density-based PAWN method \citep{pianosi_simple_2015} emphasizes the importance of OM degradation rate parameters ($k_i$, $f_i$) and thus highlights the need for the development of 
an objective, global framework to parameterize OM degradation rate parameters. We have shown that the performance of OMEN-SED is similar to that of a fully formulated, multi-component numerical model. The new analytical model 
is able to reproduce observed pore water profiles across a wide range of depositional environments and captures observed global patterns of SWI-fluxes, oxygen penetration depths, biogeochemical reaction rates, as well as surface 
sediment organic matter contents. Coupled to EMICs or higher resolution Earth system models, OMEN-SED is thus well suited to examine the role of sediments in global biogeochemical cycles in response to a wide range of past 
or future carbon cycle or climate perturbations over various timescales.
