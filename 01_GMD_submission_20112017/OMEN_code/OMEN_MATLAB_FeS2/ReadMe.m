% Email: dominik.huelse@ucr.edu or dominik.huelse@gmx.de


% 1) Example for executing the model:
% How to calculate a single sediment column with default parameters and plotting results:
% Execute with from the directory including the MATLAB source code files
% >> benthic_test.run_OMEN
% 1) default sediment-water interface boundary conditions are set as
%    prescribed in benthic_test.default_swi() and in the properties of
%    benthic_main.m, OM degradation constants need to be changed in benthic_zTOC.m
% 2) the subroutines for the different species are called in benthic_test.test_benthic(1,swi):
% 3) results saved in res and are plotted with benthic_test.plot_column()

% 2) OUTPUT:
% 2.1) Sediment profiles: will be automatically calculated and plotted by
% benthic_test.plot_column(). Two EPS files are saved in the working directory.
% 
% 2.2) Other results like O2, NO3, SO4 penetration depths (i.e. zox, zNO3, zSO4) and simulated
% sediment-water interface fluxes (i.e. flxswiO2, flxswiNO3, flxswiNH4, flxswiSO4,flxswiH2S, flxswiP, flxswiALK, flxswiDIC) 
% are printed in the MATLAB terminal.
